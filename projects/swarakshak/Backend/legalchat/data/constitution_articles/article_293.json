The Draft Article stated that the executive power of the State extends to borrowing within India upon the security of revenues of the State. The Government of India may give loans to the State and may give guarantees to the loans raised by any State. A State cannot raise any loans without the consent of the Government of India if there is any part of the loan made to the State by the Government of India still outstanding.\nThe Chairman of the Drafting Committee\nmoved\nthree amendments as follows.\n“i. That in clause (1) of article 269, the words and figures ‘for the time being specified in Part I of the First Schedule’ be omitted.\nii. That in clause (1) of article 269, for the words ‘revenues of the State’ the words ‘Consolidated Fund of the State’ be substituted.\nThat with reference to amendment No. 2972 of the List of Amendments for clause (2) of article 269, the following clause be substituted :-\niii. (2) The Government of India may, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by or under any law made by Parliament, make loans to any State or, so long as any limits fixed under article 268 of this Constitution are not exceeded, give guarantees in respect of loans raised by any State, and any sums required for the purpose of making such loans shall be charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.”\nOne Member\nnoted\nthat the issue of borrowings and loans requires greater scrutiny as borrowing imposes heavy obligations upon not only the present generation but also the future generation and suggested that a Commission akin to Finance Commission may be constituted for all the time a loan needs to be raised.\nIt was\nobserved\nthat under the Government of India Act, there was a clause that the consent for borrowing ought not to be unreasonably delayed. Such a provision is not found in article 269, which the Member felt was not necessary with National Government both at the Centre and in the Provinces. He considered that this will help to keep a closer scrutiny of revenues of the Union and Provinces. The matter of raising loan would be placed before the Parliament and the Executive will not take the entire responsibility on itself.\nOne Member\nraised\nconcerns over the ability of the Parliament to manage the financial complexities over borrowing including maintaining the national credit of India. He questioned who will determine about the paying capacity of States in case they want to borrow money. He argued for greater oversight by the Auditor-General to review and report the credit conditions of each province to the Parliament.\nAll the amendments were\nadopted\n. Draft Article 269 as amended was\nadopted\non the same day.\nWe are a not-for-profit initiative.
