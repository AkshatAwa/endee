    "148": "Court to decide when question shall be asked a nd when witness compelled to answer . –– If any such question relates to a matter not relevant to the suit or proceeding, except in so far as it a ffects the credit of the witness by injuring his character, th e Court shall decide whether or not the witness sha ll be compelled to answer it, and may, if it thinks fit, warn the witness that he is not obliged to answer i t. In exercising its discretion, the Court shall have reg ard to the following considerations:–– (1) such questions are proper if they are of such a n ature that the truth of the imputation conveyed by them would seriously affect the opinion of the C ourt as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies; (2) such questions are improper if the imputation whi ch they convey relates to matters so remote in time, or of such a character, that the truth of the imputation would not affect, or would affect in  a slight degree, the opinion of the Court as to the c redibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies; (3) such questions are improper if there is a great d isproportion between the importance of the imputation made against the witness’s character and  the importance of his evidence; (4) the Court may, if it sees fit, draw, from the wit ness’s refusal to answer, the inference that the answer if given would be unfavourable.",

Illustrations (a) A barrister is instructed by an attorney or vakil  that an important witness is a dakait. This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he  is a dakait. (b) A pleader is informed by a person in Court that a n important witness is a dakait. The informant, on being questioned by the pleader, gives satisfact ory reasons for his statement. This is a reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a dakai t. (c) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known is a sked at random whether he is a dakait. There are here no reasonable ground for the question. (d) A witness, of whom nothing whatever is known, bei ng questioned as to his mode of life and means of living, gives unsatisfactory answers. This  may be a reasonable ground for asking him if he is  a dakait.",

Exception 1.–– If a witness is asked whether he has been prev iously convicted of any crime and denies it, evidence may be given of his previous co nviction. Exception 2.–– If a witness is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality, and answers it by denying the facts suggested, he may be contradic ted. Illustrations (a) A claim against an underwriter is resisted on the  ground of fraud. The claimant is asked whether, in a former transact ion, he had not made a fraudulent claim. He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that he did make such a claim. The evidence is inadmissible. (b) A witness is asked whether he was not dismissed f rom a situation for dishonesty. He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that he was dismissed f or dishonesty. The evidence is not admissible. (c) A affirms that on a certain day he saw B at Lahor e. A is asked whether he himself was not on that day a t Calcutta. He denies it. Evidence is offered to show that A was on that day at Calcutta. The evidence is admissible, not as contradicting A on a fact which affects his credit, but as contradicting the alleged fact that B was seen on t he day in question in Lahore. In each of these cases the witness might, if his de nial was false, be charged with giving false evidence. (d) A is asked whether his family has not had a blood feud with the family of B against whom he gives evidence. He denies it. He may be contradicted on the ground that the question tends to impeach his impartiality.",

Illustration A, an accomplice, gives an account of a robbery in  which he took part.

When witness may use copy of document to refresh me mory.  –– Whenever a witness may refresh his memory by reference to any document, he may, wi th the permission of the Court, refer to a copy of such document: Provided the Court be satisfied that there is suffi cient reason for the non-production of the original . An expert may refresh his memory by reference to pr ofessional treatises.",
