  "text": "(1) The property and income of a State shall be exempt from Union taxation.\n⁠\n(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall prevent the Union from imposing, or authorising the imposition of, any tax to such extent, if any, as Parliament may by law provide in respect of a trade or business of any kind carried on by, or on behalf of, the Government of a State, or any operations connected therewith, or any property used or occupied for the purposes of such trade or business, or any income accruing or arising in connection therewith.\n⁠\n(3) Nothing in clause (2) shall apply to any trade or business, or to any class of trade or business, which Parliament may by law declare to be incidental to the ordinary functions of government.\nSUMMARY\n9 September 1949\n. This Draft Article regulates taxation of a State Government by the Union. It did not permit the Union to tax State Governments on lands or buildings and income accruing within the State. However, it allowed the Union to tax State Governments on its trade or business. Further, it also allowed taxation of rulers of princely states on their personal property and income.\nThe Chairman of the Drafting Committee\nproposed\nan amendment to replace the Draft Article and provide that the Union would not tax property and income of the State governments. However, Parliament by law could empower the Union to tax income from trade or business of the State governments excluding trade or business declared as incidental to ordinary functions of government by Parliament.\nMany Members\nproposed\namendments to curtail the power the Union to tax the State Governments. They suggested excluding (i) trade and business carried on within the State, (ii) trade and business carried on before the commencement of the Constitution and (iii) programmes of their development and expansion; the preparations for which are complete.\nThe Finance Minister\nreassured\nthe Members that public utility undertakings would be outside the scope of taxation and there would not be any discrimination between the Union and the State in regard to the taxation of industrial undertakings. Based on these assurances, these amendments were subsequently\nwithdrawn\n.\nThe Assembly adopted the Draft Article as amended by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee on\n9 September 1949\n.\nWe are a not-for-profit initiative.
