Another member was\nworried\nthat the amendment would set a dangerous precedent especially since there was already an Article (Article 81) that already dealt with the representation of minority communities. A third member\nargued\nthat Draft Article 293 was an exception to the earlier Article and was necessary because the Anglo-Indian community was extremely small and needed to be represented in the Lok Sabha.\nThe amendment was\nrejected\nby the Assembly, and the Draft Article was\nadopted\nwithout any changes on the same day.\nWe are a not-for-profit initiative.
