The issue reaches out to the foundation of a\nconstitutional culture based on the protection of human rights and enables this Court\nto revisit the basic principles on which our Constitution has been founded and their\nconsequences for a way of life it seeks to protect. This case presents challenges for\nconstitutional interpretation. If privacy is to be construed as a protected constitutional\nvalue, it would redefine in significant ways our concepts of liberty and the entitlements\nthat flow out of its protection.\n2      Privacy, in its simplest sense, allows each human being to be left alone in a\ncore which is inviolable. Yet the autonomy of the individual is conditioned by her\nrelationships with the rest of society. Those relationships may and do often pose\nquestions to autonomy and free choice. The overarching presence of state and non-\nstate entities regulates aspects of social existence which bear upon the freedom of\nthe individual. The preservation of constitutional liberty is, so to speak, work in\nprogress. Challenges have to be addressed to existing problems. Equally, new\nchallenges have to be dealt with in terms of a constitutional understanding of where\nliberty places an individual in the context of a social order. The emergence of new\nchallenges is exemplified by this case, where the debate on privacy is being analysed\nin the context of a global information based society. In an age where information\ntechnology governs virtually every aspect of our lives, the task before the Court is to\n4\nPART A\nimpart constitutional meaning to individual liberty in an interconnected world. While\nwe revisit the question whether our constitution protects privacy as an elemental\nprinciple, the Court has to be sensitive to the needs of and the opportunities and\ndangers posed to liberty in a digital world.\n3      A Bench of three judges of this Court, while considering the constitutional\nchallenge to the Aadhaar card scheme of the Union government noted in its order\ndated 11 August 2015 that the norms for and compilation of demographic biometric\ndata by government was questioned on the ground that it violates the right to privacy.\nThe Attorney General for India urged that the existence of a fundamental right of\nprivacy is in doubt in view of two decisions : the first – M P Sharma v Satish Chandra,\nDistrict Magistrate, Delhi1 (“M P Sharma”) was rendered by a Bench of eight\njudges and the second, in Kharak Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh2 (“Kharak\nSingh”) was rendered by a Bench of six judges. Each of these decisions, in the\nsubmission of the Attorney General, contained observations that the Indian\nConstitution does not specifically protect the right to privacy.\nOn the other hand, the\nsubmission of the petitioners was that M P Sharma and Kharak Singh were founded\non principles expounded in\nA K Gopalan v State of Madras3 (“Gopalan”\n).\nGopalan,\nwhich construed each provision contained in the Chapter on fundamental rights as\nembodying a distinct protection, was held not to be good law by an eleven-judge\n1\n(1954) SCR 1077\n2\n(1964) 1 SCR 332\n3\nAIR 1950 SC 27\n5\nPART A\nBench in Rustom Cavasji Cooper v Union of India4 (“Cooper”). Hence the\npetitioners submitted that the basis of the two earlier decisions is not valid. Moreover,\nit was also urged that in the seven-judge Bench decision in Maneka Gandhi v Union\nof India5 (“Maneka”), the minority judgment of Justice Subba Rao in Kharak Singh\nwas specifically approved of and the decision of the majority was overruled.\n4      While addressing these challenges, the Bench of three judges of this Court took\nnote of several decisions of this Court in which the right to privacy has been held to\nbe a constitutionally protected fundamental right.\nThose decisions include :\nGobind\nv State of Madhya Pradesh6 (“Gobind”\n),\nR Rajagopal v State of Tamil Nadu7\n(“Rajagopal”\n) and People’s Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India8 (“PUCL”).\nThese subsequent decisions which affirmed the existence of a constitutionally\nprotected right of privacy, were rendered by Benches of a strength smaller than those\nin M P Sharma and Kharak Singh. Faced with this predicament and having due\nregard to the far-reaching questions of importance involving interpretation of the\nConstitution, it was felt that institutional integrity and judicial discipline would require\na reference to a larger Bench. Hence the Bench of three learned judges observed in\nits order dated 11 August 2015:\n“12. We are of the opinion that the cases on hand raise far reaching\nquestions of importance involving interpretation of the Constitution.\n4\n(1970) 1 SCC 248\n5\n(1978) 1 SCC 248\n6\n(1975) 2 SCC 148\n7\n(1994) 6 SCC 632\n8\n(1997) 1 SCC 301\n6\nPART A\nWhat is at stake is the amplitude of the fundamental rights including\nthat precious and inalienable right under\nArticle 21.\nIf the\nobservations made in\nM.P. Sharma\n(supra) and Kharak Singh\n(supra) are to be read literally and accepted as the law of this\ncountry, the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution\nof India and more particularly right to liberty under\nArticle 21\nwould\nbe denuded of vigour and vitality. At the same time, we are also of\nthe opinion that the institutional integrity and judicial discipline\nrequire that pronouncement made by larger Benches of this Court\ncannot be ignored by the smaller Benches without appropriately\nexplaining the reasons for not following the pronouncements made\nby such larger Benches. With due respect to all the learned Judges\nwho rendered the subsequent judgments - where right to privacy is\nasserted or referred to their Lordships concern for the liberty of\nhuman beings, we are of the humble opinion that there appears to\nbe certain amount of apparent unresolved contradiction in the law\ndeclared by this Court.\n13. Therefore, in our opinion to give a quietus to the kind of\ncontroversy raised in this batch of cases once for all, it is better that\nthe ratio decidendi of\nM.P. Sharma\n(supra) and Kharak Singh\n(supra) is scrutinized and the jurisprudential correctness of the\nsubsequent decisions of this Court where the right to privacy is\neither asserted or referred be examined and authoritatively decided\nby a Bench of appropriate strength.”\n5     On 18 July 2017, a Constitution Bench presided over by the learned Chief\nJustice considered it appropriate that the issue be resolved by a Bench of nine judges.\nThe order of the Constitution Bench reads thus:\n“During the course of the hearing today, it seems that it has become\nessential for us to determine whether there is any fundamental right\nof privacy under the Indian Constitution. The determination of this\nquestion would essentially entail whether the decision recorded by\nthis Court in M.P. Sharma and Ors. vs. Satish Chandra, District\nMagistrate, Delhi and Ors. - 1950 SCR 1077 by an eight-Judge\nConstitution Bench, and also, in\nKharak Singh vs. The State of\nU.P. and Ors.\n- 1962 (1) SCR 332 by a six-Judge Constitution\nBench, that there is no such fundamental right, is the correct\nexpression of the constitutional position.\n7\nPART A\nBefore dealing with the matter any further, we are of the view that\nthe issue noticed hereinabove deserves to be placed before the\nnine-Judge Constitution Bench. List these matters before the Nine-\nJudge Constitution Bench on 19.07.2017.”\n6     During the course of hearing, we have been ably assisted on behalf of the\npetitioners by Mr Gopal Subramanium, Mr Kapil Sibal, Mr Arvind Datar, Mr Shyam\nDivan, Mr Anand Grover, Ms Meenakshi Arora, Mr Sajan Poovayya and Mr Jayant\nBhushan, learned senior counsel. Mr J S Attri, learned senior counsel supported them\non behalf of the State of Himachal Pradesh. On behalf of the Union of India, the Court\nhas had the benefit of the erudite submissions of Mr K K Venugopal, Attorney General\nfor India. He has been ably supported by Mr Tushar Mehta, Additional Solicitor\nGeneral, Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, senior counsel for the State of Gujarat, Mr Aryama\nSundaram for the State of Maharashtra, Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan and Dr Arghya\nSengupta respectively. While some state governments have supported the stand of\nthe Union government, others have supported the petitioners.\n7     The correctness of the decisions in M P Sharma and Kharak Singh, is to be\nevaluated during the course of the reference. Besides, the jurisprudential correctness\nof subsequent decisions holding the right to privacy to be a constitutionally protected\nright is to be determined. The basic question whether privacy is a right protected\nunder our Constitution requires an understanding of what privacy means. For it is\nwhen we understand what interests or entitlements privacy safeguards, that we can\ndetermine whether the Constitution protects privacy. The contents of privacy need to\n8\nPART B\nbe analysed, not by providing an exhaustive enunciation or catalogue of what it\nincludes but by indicating its broad contours. The Court has been addressed on\nvarious aspects of privacy including : (i) Whether there is a constitutionally protected\nright to privacy; (ii) If there is a constitutionally protected right, whether this has the\ncharacter of an independent fundamental right or whether it arises from within the\nexisting guarantees of protected rights such as life and personal liberty; (iii) the\ndoctrinal foundations of the claim to privacy; (iv) the content of privacy; and (v) the\nnature of the regulatory power of the state.\nB         Decision in M P Sharma\n8         An investigation was ordered by the Union government under the Companies\nAct into the affairs of a company which was in liquidation on the ground that it had\nmade an organized attempt to embezzle its funds and to conceal the true state of its\naffairs from the share-holders and on the allegation that the company had indulged in\nfraudulent transactions and falsified its records. Offences were registered and search\nwarrants were issued during the course of which, records were seized. The challenge\nwas that the searches violated the fundamental rights of the petitioners under\nArticle\n19(1)(f)\nand\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution. The former challenge was rejected. The\nquestion which this Court addressed was whether there was a contravention of\nArticle\n20(3).\nArticle 20(3)\nmandates that no person accused of an offence shall be compelled\nto be a witness against himself. Reliance was placed on a judgment9 of the US\n9\nBoyd v. United States, 116 US 616 (1886)\n9\nPART B\nSupreme Court holding that obtaining incriminating evidence by an illegal search and\nseizure violates the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the American Constitution. While\ntracing the history of Indian legislation, this Court observed that provisions for search\nwere contained in successive enactments of the\nCriminal Procedure Code\n. Justice\nJagannadhadas, speaking for the Bench, held that a search or seizure does not\ninfringe the constitutional right guaranteed by\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution:\n“…there is no basis in the Indian law for the assumption that a search\nor seizure of a thing or document is in itself to be treated as compelled\nproduction of the same. Indeed a little consideration will show that the\ntwo are essentially different matters for the purpose relevant to the\npresent discussion. A notice to produce is addressed to the party\nconcerned and his production in compliance therewith constitutes a\ntestimonial act by him within the meaning of\nArticle 20(3)\nas above\nexplained. But a search warrant is addressed to an officer of the\nGovernment, generally a police officer. Neither the search nor the\nseizure are acts of the occupier of the searched premises. They are\nacts of another to which he is obliged to submit and are, therefore, not\nhis testimonial acts in any sense.”10\n9         Having held that the guarantee against self-incrimination is not offended by a\nsearch and seizure, the Court observed that :\n“A power of search and seizure is in any system of jurisprudence\nan overriding power of the State for the protection of social security\nand that power is necessarily regulated by law. When the\nConstitution makers have thought fit not to subject such\nregulation to constitutional limitations by recognition of a\nfundamental right to privacy, analogous to the Fourth\nAmendment, we have no justification to import it, into a totally\ndifferent fundamental right, by some process of strained\nconstruction. Nor is it legitimate to assume that the constitutional\n10\nMP Sharma (Supra note 1), at page 1096\n10\nPART C\nprotection under\nArticle 20(3)\nwould be defeated by the statutory\nprovisions for searches.”11               (emphasis supplied)\n10         These observations – to be more precise in one sentence - indicating that the\nConstitution makers did not subject the regulation by law of the power of search and\nseizure to a fundamental right of privacy, similar to the Fourth amendment of the US\nConstitution, have been pressed in aid to question the existence of a protected right\nto privacy under our Constitution.\nC          Decision in Kharak Singh\n11         After being challaned in a case of dacoity in 1941, Kharak Singh was released\nfor want of evidence. But the police compiled a “history sheet” against him. ‘History\nsheets’ were defined in\nRegulation 228\nof Chapter XX of the U P Police Regulations\nas “the personal records of criminals under surveillance”. Kharak Singh, who was\nsubjected to regular surveillance, including midnight knocks, moved this Court for a\ndeclaration that his fundamental rights were infringed.                Among the measures of\nsurveillance contemplated by\nRegulation 236\nwere the following:\n“(a) Secret picketing of the house or approaches to the houses of\nsuspects;\n(b) domiciliary visits at night;\n(c) thorough periodical inquiries by officers not below the rank of\nsub-inspector into repute, habits, associations, income, expenses\nand occupation;\n(d) the reporting by constables and chaukidars of movements and\nabsences from home;\n11\nIbid, at page 1096-97\n11\nPART C\n(c) the verification of movements and absences by means of inquiry\nslips;\n(f) the collection and record on a history-sheet of all information\nbearing on conduct.”\n12         This Court held that the freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India,\nguaranteed by\nArticle 19(1)(d)\nwas not infringed by a midnight knock on the door of\nthe petitioner since “his locomotion is not impeded or prejudiced in any manner”.\n13         When the decision in Kharak Singh was handed down, the principles\ngoverning the inter-relationship between the rights protected by\nArticle 19\nand the\nright to life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21\nwere governed by the judgment in\nGopalan. Gopalan considered each of the articles in the Chapter on fundamental\nrights as embodying distinct (as opposed to over-lapping) freedoms. Hence in Kharak\nSingh, the Court observed :\n“In view of the very limited nature of the question before us it is\nunnecessary to pause to consider either the precise relationship\nbetween the “liberties” in\nArticle 19(1)(a)\n& (d) on the one hand and\nthat in\nArticle 21\non the other, or the content and significance of the\nwords “procedure established by law” in the latter Article, both of\nwhich were the subject of elaborate consideration by this Court\nin\nA.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras.”12\n14         The decision in Kharak Singh held that clause (b) of\nRegulation 236\nwhich\nprovided for domiciliary visits at night was violative of\nArticle 21.\nThe Court observed:\n“Is then the word “personal liberty” to be construed as excluding\nfrom its purview an invasion on the part of the police of the sanctity\n12\nKharak Singh (Supra note 2), at page 345\n12\nPART C\nof a man's home and an intrusion into his personal security and his\nright to sleep which is the normal comfort and a dire necessity for\nhuman existence even as an animal? It might not be inappropriate\nto refer here to the words of the preamble to the Constitution that it\nis designed to “assure the dignity of the individual” and therefore of\nthose cherished human values as the means of ensuring his full\ndevelopment and evolution. We are referring to these objectives of\nthe framers merely to draw attention to the concepts underlying the\nconstitution which would point to such vital words as “personal\nliberty” having to be construed in a reasonable manner and to be\nattributed that sense which would promote and achieve those\nobjectives and by no means to stretch the meaning of the phrase to\nsquare with any pre-conceived notions or doctrinaire constitutional\ntheories.”13\n15      In taking this view, Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar, speaking for a majority of five\njudges, relied upon the judgment of Justice Frankfurter, speaking for the US Supreme\nCourt in Wolf v Colorado14, which held :\n“The security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the\npolice … is basic to a free society…\nWe have no hesitation in saying that were a State affirmatively to\nsanction such police incursion into privacy it would run counter to\nthe guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.”15 (emphasis supplied)\nWhile the Court observed that the Indian Constitution does not contain a guarantee\nsimilar to the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution, it proceeded to hold that :\n“Nevertheless, these extracts would show that an unauthorised\nintrusion into a person's home and the disturbance caused to\nhim thereby, is as it were the violation of a common law right of\na man an ultimate essential of ordered liberty, if not of the very\n13\nIbid, at pages 347-348\n14\n338 US 25 (1949)\n15\nCited in Kharak Singh (Supra note 2), at page 348\n13\nPART C\nconcept of civilisation. An English Common Law maxim asserts that\n“every man's house is his castle” and in Semayne case [5 Coke\n91 : 1 Sm LC (13th Edn) 104 at p. 105] where this was applied, it\nwas stated that “the house of everyone is to him as his castle\nand fortress as well as for his defence against injury and violence\nas for his repose”. We are not unmindful of the fact that Semayne\ncase [(1604) 5 Coke 91 : 1 Sm LC (13th Edn) 104 at p. 105] was\nconcerned with the law relating to executions in England, but the\npassage extracted has a validity quite apart from the context of the\nparticular decision. It embodies an abiding principle which\ntranscends mere protection of property rights and expounds a\nconcept of “personal liberty” which does not rest on any element\nof feudalism or on any theory of freedom which has ceased to be of\nvalue.”16         (emphasis supplied)\n16         Kharak Singh regards the sanctity of the home and the protection against\nunauthorized intrusion an integral element of “ordered liberty”. This is comprised in\n‘personal liberty’ guaranteed by\nArticle 21.\nThe decision invalidated domiciliary visits\nat night authorised by\nRegulation 236 (b)\n, finding them to be an unauthorized intrusion\ninto the home of a person and a violation of the fundamental right to personal liberty.\nHowever, while considering the validity of clauses (c),(d) and (e) which provided for\nperiodical enquiries, reporting by law enforcement personnel and verification of\nmovements, this Court held as follows :\n“…the freedom guaranteed by\nArticle 19(1)(d)\nis not infringed by a\nwatch being kept over the movements of the suspect. Nor do we\nconsider that\nArticle 21\nhas any relevance in the context as was\nsought to be suggested by learned Counsel for the petitioner. As\nalready pointed out, the right of privacy is not a guaranteed right\nunder our Constitution and therefore the attempt to ascertain\nthe movements of an individual which is merely a manner in\n16\nIbid, at page 349\n14\nPART C\nwhich privacy is invaded is not an infringement of a\nfundamental right guaranteed by Part III.”17 (emphasis supplied)\nIn the context of clauses (c), (d) and (e), the above extract indicates the view of the\nmajority that the right of privacy is not guaranteed under the Constitution.\n17         Justice Subba Rao dissented. Justice Subba Rao held that the rights conferred\nby Part III have overlapping areas. Where a law is challenged as infringing the right\nto freedom of movement under\nArticle 19(1)(d)\nand the liberty of the individual under\nArticle 21\n, it must satisfy the tests laid down in\nArticle 19(2)\nas well as the requirements\nof\nArticle 21.\nJustice Subba Rao held that :\n“No doubt the expression “personal liberty” is a comprehensive one\nand the right to move freely is an attribute of personal liberty. It is\nsaid that the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty\nand, therefore, the expression “personal liberty” in\nArticle 21\nexcludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach.\nBoth are independent fundamental rights, though there is\noverlapping. There is no question of one being carved out of\nanother. The fundamental right of life and personal liberty have\nmany attributes and some of them are found in\nArticle 19.\nIf a\nperson's fundamental right under\nArticle 21\nis infringed, the State\ncan rely upon a law to sustain the action; but that cannot be a\ncomplete answer unless the said law satisfies the test laid down in\nArticle 19(2)\nso far as the attributes covered by\nArticle 19(1)\nare\nconcerned. In other words, the State must satisfy that both the\nfundamental rights are not infringed by showing that there is a law\nand that it does amount to a reasonable restriction within the\nmeaning of\nArticle 19(2)\nof the Constitution. But in this case no such\ndefence is available, as admittedly there is no such law. So the\npetitioner can legitimately plead that his fundamental rights both\nunder\nArticle 19(1)(d)\nand\nArticle 21\nare infringed by the State.”18\n17\nIbid, at page 351\n18\nIbid, at pages 356-357\n15\nPART C\n18    Justice Subba Rao held that\nArticle 21\nembodies the right of the individual to\nbe free from restrictions or encroachments. In this view, though the Constitution does\nnot expressly declare the right to privacy as a fundamental right, such a right is\nessential to personal liberty. The dissenting opinion places the matter of principle as\nfollows:\n“In an uncivilized society where there are no inhibitions, only\nphysical restraints may detract from personal liberty, but as\ncivilization advances the psychological restraints are more effective\nthan physical ones. The scientific methods used to condition a\nman's mind are in a real sense physical restraints, for they\nengender physical fear channelling one's actions through\nanticipated and expected grooves. So also the creation of\nconditions which necessarily engender inhibitions and fear\ncomplexes can be described as physical restraints. Further, the\nright to personal liberty takes in not only a right to be free from\nrestrictions placed on his movements, but also free from\nencroachments on his private life. It is true our Constitution does\nnot expressly declare a right to privacy as a fundamental right,\nbut the said right is an essential ingredient of personal liberty.\nEvery democratic country sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to\ngive him rest, physical happiness, peace of mind and security. In\nthe last resort, a person's house, where he lives with his family, is\nhis “castle”; it is his rampart against encroachment on his personal\nliberty. The pregnant words of that famous Judge, Frankfurter\nJ., in Wolf v. Colorado [[1949] 238 US 25] pointing out the\nimportance of the security of one's privacy against arbitrary\nintrusion by the police, could have no less application to an\nIndian home as to an American one. If physical restraints on a\nperson's movements affect his personal liberty, physical\nencroachments on his private life would affect it in a larger degree.\nIndeed, nothing is more deleterious to a man's physical happiness\nand health than a calculated interference with his privacy. We\nwould, therefore, define the right of personal liberty in\nArticle 21\nas\na right of an individual to be free from restrictions or encroachments\non his person, whether those restrictions or encroachments are\ndirectly imposed or indirectly brought about by calculated\nmeasures. If so understood, all the acts of surveillance under\n16\nPART D\nRegulation 236\ninfringe the fundamental right of the petitioner under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution.”19      (emphasis supplied)\nSignificantly, both Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar for the majority and Justice Subba\nRao in his dissent rely upon the observations of Justice Frankfurter in Wolf v\nColorado which specifically advert to privacy. The majority, while relying upon them\nto invalidate domiciliary visits at night, regards the sanctity of the home as part of\nordered liberty. In the context of other provisions of the regulation, the majority\ndeclines to recognise a right of privacy as a constitutional protection. Justice Subba\nRao recognised a constitutional by protected right to privacy, considering it as an\ningredient of personal liberty.\nD          Gopalan doctrine : fundamental rights as isolated silos\n19         When eight judges of this Court rendered the decision in M P Sharma in 1954\nand later, six judges decided the controversy in Kharak Singh in 1962, the ascendant\nand, even well established, doctrine governing the fundamental rights contained in\nPart III was founded on the Gopalan principle. In Gopalan, Chief Justice Kania,\nspeaking for a majority of five of the Bench of six judges, construed the relationship\nbetween\nArticles 19\nand\n21\nto be one of mutual exclusion. In this line of enquiry, what\nwas comprehended by\nArticle 19\nwas excluded from\nArticle 21.\nThe seven freedoms\nof\nArticle 19\nwere not subsumed in the fabric of life or personal liberty in\nArticle 21.\n19\nIbid, at pages 358-359\n17\nPART D\nThe consequence was that a law which curtailed one of the freedoms guaranteed by\nArticle 19\nwould be required to answer the tests of reasonableness prescribed by\nclauses 2 to 6 of\nArticle 19\nand those alone. In the Gopalan perspective, free speech\nand expression was guaranteed by\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nand was hence excluded from\npersonal liberty under\nArticle 21.\nArticle 21\nwas but a residue. Chief Justice Kania\nheld :\n“Reading\nArticle 19\nin that way it appears to me that the concept of\nthe right to move freely throughout the territory of India is an entirely\ndifferent concept from the right to “personal liberty” contemplated\nby\nArticle 21.\n“Personal liberty” covers many more rights in one\nsense and has a restricted meaning in another sense. For instance,\nwhile the right to move or reside may be covered by the expression,\n“personal liberty” the right to freedom of speech (mentioned in\nArticle 19(1)(a)\n) or the right to acquire, hold or dispose of property\n(mentioned in 19(1)(f)) cannot be considered a part of\nthe personal liberty of a citizen. They form part of the liberty of a\ncitizen but the limitation imposed by the word “personal” leads me\nto believe that those rights are not covered by the expression\npersonal liberty. So read there is no conflict between Articles 19 and\n21. The contents and subject-matters of\nArticles 19\nand\n21\nare thus\nnot the same and they proceed to deal with the rights covered by\ntheir respective words from totally different angles. As already\nmentioned in respect of each of the rights specified in sub-clauses\nof\nArticle 19(1)\nspecific limitations in respect of each is provided,\nwhile the expression “personal liberty” in\nArticle 21\nis generally\ncontrolled by the general expression “procedure established by\nlaw”.”20\n‘Procedure established by law’ under\nArticle 21\nwas, in this view, not capable of being\nexpanded to include the ‘due process of law’. Justice Fazl Ali dissented. The dissent\n20\nGopalan\n(Supra note 3), at pages 36-37\n18\nPART D\nadopted the view that the fundamental rights are not isolated and separate but protect\na common thread of liberty and freedom:\n“To my mind, the scheme of the Chapter dealing with the\nfundamental rights does not contemplate what is attributed to it,\nnamely, that each article is a code by itself and is independent of\nthe others. In my opinion, it cannot be said that Articles 19,20, 21\nand 22 do not to some extent overlap each other. The case of a\nperson who is convicted of an offence will come under\nArticles 20\nand\n21\nand also under\nArticle 22\nso far as his arrest and detention\nin custody before trial are concerned. Preventive detention, which\nis dealt with an\nArticle 22\n, also amounts to deprivation of personal\nliberty which is referred to in\nArticle 21\n, and is a violation of the right\nof freedom of movement dealt with in\nArticle 19(1)(d)\n…\nIt seems clear that the addition of the word “personal” before\n“liberty” in\nArticle 21\ncannot change the meaning of the words used\nin\nArticle 19\n, nor can it put a matter which is inseparably bound up\nwith personal liberty beyond its place...”21\n20         In Satwant Singh Sawhney v D Ramarathnam22 (“Satwant Singh\nSawhney”), Justice Hidayatullah, speaking for himself and Justice R S Bachawat, in\nthe dissenting view noticed the clear lines of distinction between the dissent of Justice\nSubba Rao and the view of the majority in Kharak Singh. The observations of Justice\nHidayatullah indicate that if the right of locomotion is embodied by\nArticle 21\nof which\none aspect is covered by\nArticle 19(1)(d)\n, that would in fact advance the minority view\nin Kharak Singh:\n“Subba Rao J. (as he then was) read personal liberty as the\nantithesis of physical restraint or coercion and found that\nArticles\n19(1)\nand\n21\noverlapped and\nArticle 19(1)(d)\nwas not carved out of\npersonal liberty in\nArticle 21.\nAccording to him, personal liberty\ncould be curtailed by law, but that law must satisfy the test in Article\n21\nIbid, at pages 52-53\n22\n(1967) 3 SCR 525\n19\nPART E\n19(2) in so far as the specific rights in\nArticle 19(1)(3)\nare\nconcerned. In other words, the State must satisfy that both the\nfundamental rights are not infringed by showing that there is a law\nand that it does not amount to an unreasonable restriction within\nthe meaning of\nArticle 19(2)\nof the Constitution. As in that case\nthere was no law, fundamental rights, both under\nArticle 19(1)(d)\nand\nArticle 21\nwere held to be infringed. The learned Chief Justice\nhas read into the decision of the Court a meaning which it does not\nintend to convey. He excludes from\nArticle 21\nthe right to free\nmotion and locomotion within the territories of India and puts the\nright to travel abroad in\nArticle 21.\nHe wants to see a law and if his\nearlier reasoning were to prevail, the law should stand the test of\nArticle 19(2).\nBut since clause (2) deals with matters in\nArticle 19(1)\nalready held excluded, it is obvious that it will not apply. The law\nwhich is made can only be tested on the ground of articles other\nthan\nArticle 19\nsuch as\nArticles 14\n, 20\nand\n22\nwhich alone bears\nupon this matter. In other words, the majority decision of the Court\nin this case has rejected Ayyangar J.'s view and accepted the view\nof the minority in Kharak Singh case…\nThis view obviously clashes with the reading of\nArticle 21\nin Kharak\nSingh case, because there the right of motion and locomotion was\nheld to be excluded from\nArticle 21.\nIn other words, the present\ndecision advances the minority view in Kharak Singh case above\nthe majority view stated in that case.”23\nE          Cooper and Maneka : Interrelationship between rights\n21         The theory that the fundamental rights are water-tight compartments was\ndiscarded in the judgment of eleven judges of this Court in Cooper. Gopalan had\nadopted the view that a law of preventive detention would be tested for its validity only\nwith reference to\nArticle 22\n, which was a complete code relating to the subject.\nLegislation on preventive detention did not, in this view, have to meet the touchstone\nof\nArticle 19(1)(d).\nThe dissenting view of Justice Fazl Ali in Gopalan was noticed by\n23\nIbid, at page 554\n20\nPART E\nJustice J C Shah, speaking for this Court, in Cooper. The consequence of the\nGopalan doctrine was that the protection afforded by a guarantee of personal freedom\nwould be decided by the object of the State action in relation to the right of the\nindividual and not upon its effect upon the guarantee. Disagreeing with this view, the\nCourt in Cooper held thus :\n”…it is necessary to bear in mind the enunciation of the guarantee\nof fundamental rights which has taken different forms. In some\ncases it is an express declaration of a guaranteed right:\nArticles\n29(1)\n, 30(1)\n, 26\n, 25\nand\n32;\nin others to ensure protection of\nindividual rights they take specific forms of restrictions on State\naction — legislative or executive —\nArticles 14\n, 15\n, 16\n, 20\n, 21\n,\n22(1)\n, 27\nand\n28;\nin some others, it takes the form of a positive\ndeclaration and simultaneously enunciates the restriction thereon:\nArticles 19(1) and 19(2) to (6); in some cases, it arises as an\nimplication from the delimitation of the authority of the State, e.g.\nArticles 31(1) and 31(2); in still others, it takes the form of a general\nprohibition against the State as well as others: Articles 17, 23 and\n24. The enunciation of rights either express or by implication\ndoes not follow a uniform pattern. But one thread runs through\nthem: they seek to protect the rights of the individual or groups\nof individuals against infringement of those rights within\nspecific limits. Part III of the Constitution weaves a pattern of\nguarantees on the texture of basic human rights. The\nguarantees delimit the protection of those rights in their\nallotted fields: they do not attempt to enunciate distinct\nrights.”24                               (emphasis supplied)\n22         The abrogation of the Gopalan doctrine in Cooper was revisited in a seven-\njudge Bench decision in Maneka. Justice P N Bhagwati who delivered the leading\nopinion of three Judges held that the judgment in Cooper affirms the dissenting\n24\nCooper (Supra note 4), at page 289 (para 52)\n21\nPART E\nopinion of Justice Subba Rao (in Kharak Singh) as expressing the valid constitutional\nposition. Hence in Maneka, the Court held that:\n“It was in\nKharak Singh v. State of U.P.\n[AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1964)\n1 SCR 332 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 329] that the question as to the proper\nscope and meaning of the expression “personal liberty” came up\npointedly for consideration for the first time before this Court. The\nmajority of the Judges took the view “that “personal liberty” is used\nin the article as a compendious term to include within itself all the\nvarieties of rights which go to make up the “personal liberties” of\nman other than those dealt with in the several clauses of\nArticle\n19(1).\nIn other words, while\nArticle 19(1)\ndeals with particular\nspecies or attributes of that freedom, ‘personal liberty’ in\nArticle 21\ntakes in and comprises the residue. The minority Judges, however,\ndisagreed with this view taken by the majority and explained their\nposition in the following words: “No doubt the expression ‘personal\nliberty’ is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an\nattribute of personal liberty. It is said that the freedom to move freely\nis carved out of personal liberty and, therefore, the expression\n‘personal liberty’ in\nArticle 21\nexcludes that attribute. In our view,\nthis is not a correct approach. Both are independent fundamental\nrights, though there is overlapping. There is no question of one\nbeing carved out of another. The fundamental right of life and\npersonal liberty has many attributes and some of them are found in\nArticle 19.\nIf a person's fundamental right under\nArticle 21\nis\ninfringed, the State can rely upon a law to sustain the action, but\nthat cannot be a complete answer unless the said law satisfies the\ntest\nlaid down in\nArticle 19(2)\nso far as the attributes covered by\nArticle 19(1)\nare concerned.” There can be no doubt that in view\nof the decision of this Court in R.C. Cooper v. Union of\nIndia [(1970) 2 SCC 298 : (1971) 1 SCR 512] the minority view\nmust be regarded as correct and the majority view must be\nheld to have been overruled.”25                     (emphasis supplied)\n23         Following the decision in Maneka, the established constitutional doctrine is that\nthe expression ‘personal liberty’ in\nArticle 21\ncovers a variety of rights, some of which\n25\nManeka (Supra Note 5), at page 278 (para 5)\n22\nPART E\n‘have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights’ and given additional\nprotection under\nArticle 19.\nConsequently, in Satwant Singh Sawhney, the right to\ntravel abroad was held to be subsumed within\nArticle 21\nas a consequence of which\nany deprivation of that right could be only by a ‘procedure established by law’. Prior\nto the enactment of the\nPassports Act, 1967\n, there was no law regulating the right to\ntravel abroad as a result of which the order of the Passport Officer refusing a passport\nwas held to be invalid. The decision in Maneka carried the constitutional principle of\nthe   over-lapping   nature   of   fundamental     rights   to   its   logical   conclusion.\nReasonableness which is the foundation of the guarantee against arbitrary state\naction under\nArticle 14\ninfuses\nArticle 21.\nA law which provides for a deprivation of life\nor personal liberty under\nArticle 21\nmust lay down not just any procedure but a\nprocedure which is fair, just and reasonable.\n24     The decisions in M P Sharma and Kharak Singh adopted a doctrinal position\non the relationship between\nArticles 19\nand\n21\n, based on the view of the majority in\nGopalan. This view stands abrogated particularly by the judgment in Cooper and the\nsubsequent statement of doctrine in Maneka. The decision in Maneka, in fact,\nexpressly recognized that it is the dissenting judgment of Justice Subba Rao in\nKharak Singh which represents the exposition of the correct constitutional principle.\nThe jurisprudential foundation which held the field sixty three years ago in M P\nSharma and fifty five years ago in Kharak Singh has given way to what is now a\nsettled position in constitutional law. Firstly, the fundamental rights emanate from\nbasic notions of liberty and dignity and the enumeration of some facets of liberty as\n23\nPART E\ndistinctly protected rights under\nArticle 19\ndoes not denude\nArticle 21\nof its expansive\nambit. Secondly, the validity of a law which infringes the fundamental rights has to be\ntested not with reference to the object of state action but on the basis of its effect on\nthe guarantees of freedom. Thirdly, the requirement of\nArticle 14\nthat state action\nmust not be arbitrary and must fulfil the requirement of reasonableness, imparts\nmeaning to the constitutional guarantees in Part III.\n25    The doctrinal invalidation of the basic premise underlying the decisions in M P\nSharma and Kharak Singh still leaves the issue of whether privacy is a right protected\nby Part III of the Constitution open for consideration. There are observations in both\ndecisions that the Constitution does not contain a specific protection of the right to\nprivacy. Presently, the matter can be looked at from the perspective of what actually\nwas the controversy in the two cases. M P Sharma was a case where a law\nprescribing a search to obtain documents for investigating into offences was\nchallenged as being contrary to the guarantee against self-incrimination in\nArticle\n20(3).\nThe Court repelled the argument that a search for documents compelled a\nperson accused of an offence to be witness against himself. Unlike a notice to produce\ndocuments, which is addressed to a person and whose compliance would constitute\na testimonial act, a search warrant and a seizure which follows are not testimonial\nacts of a person to whom the warrant is addressed, within the meaning of\nArticle 20(3).\nThe Court having held this, the controversy in M P Sharma would rest at that. The\nobservations in M P Sharma to the effect that the constitution makers had not thought\nit fit to subject the regulatory power of search and seizure to constitutional limitations\n24\nPART E\nby recognising a fundamental right of privacy (like the US Fourth amendment), and\nthat there was no justification to impart it into a ‘totally different fundamental right’ are\nat the highest, stray observations.\n26     The decision in M P Sharma held that in the absence of a provision like the\nFourth Amendment to the US Constitution, a right to privacy cannot be read into the\nIndian Constitution. The decision in M P Sharma did not decide whether a\nconstitutional right to privacy is protected by other provisions contained in the\nfundamental rights including among them, the right to life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21.\nHence the decision cannot be construed to specifically exclude the\nprotection of privacy under the framework of protected guarantees including those in\nArticles 19\nor 21. The absence of an express constitutional guarantee of privacy still\nbegs the question whether privacy is an element of liberty and, as an integral part of\nhuman dignity, is comprehended within the protection of life as well.\n27     The decision in Kharak Singh is noteworthy because while invalidating\nRegulation 236(b) of the Police Regulations which provided for nightly domiciliary\nvisits, the majority construed this to be an unauthorized intrusion into a person’s home\nand a violation of ordered liberty. While arriving at this conclusion, the majority\nplaced reliance on the privacy doctrine enunciated by Justice Frankfurter, speaking\nfor the US Supreme Court in Wolf v Colorado (the extract from Wolf cited in the\nmajority judgment specifically adverts to ‘privacy’ twice). Having relied on this doctrine\n25\nPART F\nto invalidate domiciliary visits, the majority in Kharak Singh proceeded to repel the\nchallenge to other clauses of Regulation 236 on the ground that the right of privacy is\nnot guaranteed under the Constitution and hence\nArticle 21\nhad no application. This\npart of the judgment in Kharak Singh is inconsistent with the earlier part of the\ndecision. The decision of the majority in Kharak Singh suffers from an internal\ninconsistency.\nF       Origins of privacy\n28      An evaluation of the origins of privacy is essential in order to understand\nwhether (as the Union of India postulates), the concept is so amorphous as to defy\ndescription. The submission of the government is that the Court cannot recognize a\njuristic concept which is so vague and uncertain that it fails to withstand constitutional\nscrutiny. This makes it necessary to analyse the origins of privacy and to trace its\nevolution.\n29      The Greek philosopher Aristotle spoke of a division between the public sphere\nof political affairs (which he termed the polis) and the personal sphere of human life\n(termed oikos). This dichotomy may provide an early recognition of “a confidential\nzone on behalf of the citizen”26. Aristotle’s distinction between the public and private\nrealms can be regarded as providing a basis for restricting governmental authority to\nactivities falling within the public realm. On the other hand, activities in the private\nMichael C. James, “A Comparative Analysis of the Right to Privacy in the United States, Canada and Europe”,\n26\nConnecticut Journal of International Law (Spring 2014), Vol. 29, Issue 2, at page 261\n26\nPART F\nrealm are more appropriately reserved for “private reflection, familial relations and\nself-determination”27.\n30      At a certain level, the evolution of the doctrine of privacy has followed the public\n– private distinction. William Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland (1765) spoke about this distinction while dividing wrongs into private wrongs\nand public wrongs. Private wrongs are an infringement merely of particular rights\nconcerning individuals and are in the nature of civil injuries. Public wrongs constitute\na breach of general and public rights affecting the whole community and according to\nhim, are called crimes and misdemeanours.\n31      John Stuart Mill in his essay, ‘On Liberty’ (1859) gave expression to the need\nto preserve a zone within which the liberty of the citizen would be free from the\nauthority of the state. According to Mill :\n“The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable\nto society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely\nconcerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over\nhimself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.”28\nWhile speaking of a “struggle between liberty and authority” 29, Mill posited that the\ntyranny of the majority could be reined by the recognition of civil rights such as the\nindividual right to privacy, free speech, assembly and expression.\n27\nIbid, at page 262\n28\nJohn Stuart Mill, On Liberty, Batoche Books (1859), at page 13\n29\nIbid, at page 6\n27\nPART F\n32     Austin in his Lectures on Jurisprudence (1869) spoke of the distinction\nbetween the public and the private realms : jus publicum and jus privatum.\nThe distinction between the public and private realms has its limitations. If the reason\nfor protecting privacy is the dignity of the individual, the rationale for its existence does\nnot cease merely because the individual has to interact with others in the public arena.\nThe extent to which an individual expects privacy in a public street may be different\nfrom that which she expects in the sanctity of the home. Yet if dignity is the underlying\nfeature, the basis of recognising the right to privacy is not denuded in public spaces.\nThe extent of permissible state regulation may, however, differ based on the legitimate\nconcerns of governmental authority.\n33     James Madison, who was the architect of the American Constitution,\ncontemplated the protection of the faculties of the citizen as an incident of the\ninalienable property rights of human beings. In his words :\n“In the former sense, a man’s land, or merchandize, or money is\ncalled his property. In the latter sense, a man has property in his\nopinions and the free communication of them…\nHe has an equal property interest in the free use of his faculties and\nfree choice of the objects on which to employ them. In a word, as a\nman is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said\nto have a property in his rights. Where an excess of power prevails,\nproperty of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions,\nhis person, his faculties or his possessions…\nConscience is the most sacred of all property; other property\ndepending in part on positive law, the exercise of that, being a\nnatural and inalienable right. To guard a man’s house as his castle,\n28\nPART F\nto pay public and enforce private debts with the most exact faith,\ncan give no title to invade a man’s conscience which is more sacred\nthan his castle, or to withhold from it that debt of protection, for\nwhich the public faith is pledged, by the very nature and original\nconditions of the social pact.”30\nMadison traced the recognition of an inviolable zone to an inalienable right to property.\nProperty is construed in the broadest sense to include tangibles and intangibles and\nultimately to control over one’s conscience itself.\n34       In an article published on 15 December 1890 in the Harvard Law Review,\nSamuel D Warren and Louis Brandeis adverted to the evolution of the law to\nincorporate within it, the right to life as “a recognition of man’s spiritual nature, of his\nfeelings and his intellect”31. As legal rights were broadened, the right to life had “come\nto mean the right to enjoy life – the right to be let alone”. Recognizing that “only a\npart of the pain, pleasure and profit of life lay in physical things” and that “thoughts,\nemotions, and sensations demanded legal recognition”, Warren and Brandeis\nrevealed with a sense of perspicacity the impact of technology on the right to be let\nalone:\n“Recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next\nstep which must be taken for the protection of the person, and for\nsecuring to the individual what Judge Cooley calls the right “to be\nlet alone”. Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise\nhave invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life; and\nnumerous mechanical devices threaten to make good the\nprediction that “what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed\n30\nJames Madison, “Essay on Property”, in Gaillard Hunt ed., The Writings of James Madison (1906), Vol. 6, at\npages 101-103.\n31\nWarren and Brandeis, “The Right to Privacy”, Harvard Law Review (1890), Vol.4, No. 5, at page 193\n29\nPART F\nfrom the house-tops.” For years there has been a feeling that the\nlaw must afford some remedy for the unauthorized circulation of\nportraits of private persons…\nThe intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing\ncivilization, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world,\nand man, under the refining influence of culture, has become more\nsensitive to publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become\nmore essential to the individual; but modern enterprise and\ninvention have, through invasions upon his privacy, subjected him\nto mental pain and distress, far greater than could be inflicted by\nmere bodily injury.”32\nIn their seminal article, Warren and Brandeis observed that:\n“The principle which protects personal writings and all other\npersonal productions, not against theft and physical appropriation,\nbut against publication in any form, is in reality not the principle of\nprivate property, but that of an inviolate personality.”33\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe right “to be let alone” thus represented a manifestation of “an inviolate\npersonality”, a core of freedom and liberty from which the human being had to be free\nfrom intrusion. The technology which provided a justification for the need to preserve\nthe privacy of the individual was the development of photography. The right to be let\nalone was not so much an incident of property as a reflection of the inviolable nature\nof the human personality.\n35         The ringing observations of Warren and Brandeis on the impact of technology\nhave continued relevance today in a globalized world dominated by the internet and\n32\nIbid, at pages 195-196\n33\nIbid, at page 205\n30\nPART F\ninformation technology. As societies have evolved, so have the connotations and\nambit of privacy.\n36      Though many contemporary accounts attribute the modern conception of the\n‘right to privacy’ to the Warren and Brandeis article, historical material indicates that it\nwas Thomas Cooley who adopted the phrase “the right to be let alone”, in his\nTreatise on the Law of Torts34. Discussing personal immunity, Cooley stated:\n“the right of one’s person may be said to be a right of complete\nimmunity; the right to be alone.”35\nRoscoe Pound described the Warren and Brandeis article as having done “nothing\nless than add a chapter to our law”36. However, another writer on the subject states\nthat:\n“This right to privacy was not new. Warren and Brandeis did not\neven coin the phrase, “right to privacy,” nor its common soubriquet,\n“the right to be let alone”.”37\nThe right to be let alone is a part of the right to enjoy life. The right to enjoy life is, in\nits turn, a part of the fundamental right to life of the individual.\n34\nThomas Cooley, Treatise on the Law of Torts (1888), 2nd edition\n35\nIbid, at page 29\n36\nDorothy J Glancy, “The Invention of the Right to Privacy”, Arizona Law Review (1979) Vol. 21, No.1, at page 1.\nThe article attributes the Roscoe Pound quotation to “Letter from Roscoe Pound to William Chilton (1916)” as\nquoted in Alpheus Mason, Brandeis : A Free Man’s Life 70 (1956).\n37\nIbid, at pages 2-3.\n31\nPART F\n37         The right to privacy was developed by Warren and Brandeis in the backdrop of\nthe dense urbanization which occurred particularly in the East Coast of the United\nStates. Between 1790 and 1890, the US population had risen from four million to sixty-\nthree million. The population of urban areas had grown over a hundred-fold since the\nend of the civil war. In 1890, over eight million people had immigrated to the US.\nTechnological progress and rapid innovations had led to the private realm being\nplaced under stress :\n“…technological progress during the post-Civil War decades had\nbrought to Boston and the rest of the United States “countless, little-\nnoticed revolutions” in the form of a variety of inventions which\nmade the personal lives and personalities of individuals\nincreasingly accessible to large numbers of others, irrespective of\nacquaintance, social or economic class, or the customary\nconstraints of propriety. Bell invented the telephone in Boston; the\nfirst commercial telephone exchange opened there in 1877, while\nWarren and Brandeis were students at the Harvard Law School. By\n1890 there were also telegraphs, fairly inexpensive portable\ncameras, sound recording devices, and better and cheaper\nmethods of making window glass. Warren and Brandeis recognized\nthat these advances in technology, coupled with intensified\nnewspaper enterprise, increased the vulnerability of individuals to\nhaving their actions, words, images, and personalities\ncommunicated without their consent beyond the protected circle of\nfamily and chosen friends.”38\nCoupled with this was the trend towards ‘newspaperization’39, the increasing presence\nof the print media in American society. Six months before the publication of the Warren\nand Brandeis’ article, E L Godkin, a newspaper man had published an article on the\nsame subject in Scribner’s magazine in July 1890. Godkin, however, suggested no\n38\nIbid, at pages 7-8\n39\nIbid, at page 8\n32\nPART F\nrealistic remedy for protecting privacy against intrusion, save and except “by the\ncudgel or the horsewhip”40. It was Warren and Brandeis who advocated the use of the\ncommon law to vindicate the right to privacy.41\n38       Criminal libel actions were resorted to in the US during a part of the nineteenth\ncentury but by 1890, they had virtually ceased to be “a viable protection for individual\nprivacy”42. The Sedition Act of 1789 expired in 1801. Before truth came to be accepted\nas a defence in defamation actions, criminal libel prosecutions flourished in the State\ncourts.43 Similarly, truth was not regarded as a valid defence to a civil libel action in\nmuch of the nineteenth century. By the time Warren and Brandeis wrote their article\nin 1890, publication of the truth was perhaps no longer actionable under the law of\ndefamation. It was this breach or lacuna that they sought to fill up by speaking of the\nright to privacy which would protect the control of the individual over her personality.44\nThe right to privacy evolved as a “leitmotif” representing “the long tradition of American\nindividualism”.45\n39       Conscious as we are of the limitations with which comparative frameworks46 of\nlaw and history should be evaluated, the above account is of significance.

Urbanization and economic\ndevelopment lead to a replacement of traditional social structures. Urban ghettos\nreplace the tranquillity of self-sufficient rural livelihoods. The need to protect the\nprivacy of the being is no less when development and technological change\ncontinuously threaten to place the person into public gaze and portend to submerge\nthe individual into a seamless web of inter-connected lives.\nG      Natural and inalienable rights\n40     Privacy is a concomitant of the right of the individual to exercise control over\nhis or her personality. It finds an origin in the notion that there are certain rights which\nare natural to or inherent in a human being. Natural rights are inalienable because\nthey are inseparable from the human personality. The human element in life is\nimpossible to conceive without the existence of natural rights. In 1690, John Locke\nhad in his Second Treatise of Government observed that the lives, liberties and\nestates of individuals are as a matter of fundamental natural law, a private preserve.\nThe idea of a private preserve was to create barriers from outside interference. In\n1765, William Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England spoke of\na “natural liberty”. There were, in his view, absolute rights which were vested in the\nindividual by the immutable laws of nature. These absolute rights were divided into\nwithin Classical Hindu Law”, The Centre for Internet and Society, available at https://cis-india.org/internet-\ngovernance/blog/loading-constructs-of-privacy-within-classical-hindu-law.

The right of personal security\ninvolved a legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of life, limbs, body, health and reputation\nby an individual.\n41       The notion that certain rights are inalienable was embodied in the American\nDeclaration of Independence (1776) in the following terms:\n“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\nunalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the\npursuit of happiness”.                   (emphasis supplied)\nThe term inalienable rights was incorporated in the Declaration of the Rights of Man\nand of the Citizen (1789) adopted by the French National Assembly in the following\nterms:\n“For its drafters, to ignore, to forget or to depreciate the rights of\nman are the sole causes of public misfortune and government\ncorruption. These rights are natural rights, inalienable and\nsacred, the National Assembly recognizes and proclaims them-it\ndoes not grant, concede or establish them-and their conservation is\nthe reason for all political communities; within these rights figures\nresistance to oppression”.            (emphasis supplied)\n42       In 1921, Roscoe Pound, in his work titled “The Spirit of the Common Law”,\nexplained the meaning of natural rights:\n“Natural rights mean simply interests which we think ought to be\nsecured; demands which human beings may make which we think\nought to be satisfied. It is perfectly true that neither law nor state\n35\nPART G\ncreates them. But it is fatal to all sound thinking to treat them as\nlegal conceptions. For legal rights, the devices which law employs\nto secure such of these interests as it is expedient to recognize, are\nthe work of the law and in that sense the work of the state.”47\nTwo decades later in 1942, Pound in “The Revival of Natural Law” propounded\nthat:\n“Classical natural law in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\nhad three postulates. One was natural rights, qualities of the ideal\nor perfect man in a state of perfection by virtue of which he ought\nto have certain things or be able to do certain things. These were\na guarantee of stability because the natural rights were taken\nto be immutable and inalienable. (2) The social compact, a\npostulated contract basis of civil society. Here was a guide to\nchange. (3) An ideal law of which positive laws were only\ndeclaratory; an ideal body of perfect precepts governing human\nrelations and ordering human conduct, guaranteeing the natural\nrights and expressing the social compact.”48 (emphasis supplied)\n43         In 1955, Edwin W Patterson in “A Pragmatist Looks At Natural Law and\nNatural Rights” observed that rights which individuals while making a social compact\nto create a government, reserve to themselves, are natural rights because they\noriginate in a condition of nature and survive the social compact. In his words:\n“The basic rights of the citizen in our political society are regarded\nas continuing from a prepolitical condition or as arising in society\nindependently of positive constitutions, statutes, and judicial\ndecisions, which merely seek to “secure” or “safeguard” rights\nalready reserved. These rights are not granted by a benevolent\ndespot to his grateful subjects. The “natural rights” theory thus\nprovided a convenient ideology for the preservation of such\nimportant rights as freedom of speech, freedom of religion and\nprocedural due process of law. As a pragmatist, I should prefer to\n47\nRoscoe Pound, The Spirit of the Common Law, Marshall Jones Company (1921), at page 92\n48\nRoscoe Pound, “The Revival of Natural Law”, Notre Damne Lawyer (1942), Vol. 27, No 4, at page 330\n36\nPART G\nexplain them as individual and social interests which arise or exist\nnormally in our culture and are tuned into legal rights by being\nlegally protected.” 49\n44      Natural rights are not bestowed by the state. They inhere in human beings\nbecause they are human. They exist equally in the individual irrespective of class or\nstrata, gender or orientation.\n45         Distinguishing an inalienable right to an object from the object itself\nemphasises the notion of inalienability. All human beings retain their inalienable rights\n(whatever their situation, whatever their acts, whatever their guilt or innocence). The\nconcept of natural inalienable rights secures autonomy to human beings. But the\nautonomy is not absolute, for the simple reason that, the concept of inalienable rights\npostulates that there are some rights which no human being may alienate. While\nnatural rights protect the right of the individual to choose and preserve liberty, yet the\nautonomy of the individual is not absolute or total. As a theoretical construct, it would\notherwise be strictly possible to hire another person to kill oneself or to sell oneself\ninto slavery or servitude. Though these acts are autonomous, they would be in\nviolation of inalienable rights. This is for the reason that:\n“…These acts, however autonomous, would be in violation of\ninalienable rights, as the theories would have it. They would be\nmorally invalid, and ineffective actually to alienate inalienable rights.\nAlthough self-regarding, they pretend to an autonomy that does not\nexist. Inalienable rights are precisely directed against such false\n49\nEdwin W. Patterson, “A Pragmatist Looks At Natural Law and Natural Rights”, in Arthur L. Harding ed., Natural\nLaw and Natural Rights (1955), at pages 62-63\n37\nPART G\nautonomy.\nNatural inalienable rights, like other natural rights, have long rested\nupon what has been called the law of nature of natural law. Perhaps\nall of the theories discussed above could be called law of nature or\nnatural law theories. The American tradition, even as early as 1641,\nten years before Thomas Hobbes published Leviathan, included\nclaims of natural rights, and these claims appealed to the law of\nnature, often in terms. Without a moral order of the law of nature\nsort, natural inalienable rights are difficult to pose. “’It is from natural\nlaw, and from it alone, that man obtains those rights we refer to as\ninalienable and inviolable…Human rights can have no foundation\nother than natural law.”50\n46      The idea that individuals can have rights against the State that are prior to rights\ncreated by explicit legislation has been developed as part of a liberal theory of law\npropounded by Ronald Dworkin. In his seminal work titled “Taking Rights\nSeriously”51 (1977), he states that:\n“Individual rights are political trumps held by individuals.\nIndividuals have rights when, for some reason, a collective goal is\nnot a sufficient justification for denying them what they wish, as\nindividuals, to have or to do, or not a sufficient justification for\nimposing some loss or injury upon them.”52 (emphasis supplied)\nDworkin asserts the existence of a right against the government as essential to\nprotecting the dignity of the individual:\n“It makes sense to say that a man has a fundamental right\nagainst the Government, in the strong sense, like free speech,\nif that right is necessary to protect his dignity, or his standing\n50\nCraig A. Ster and Gregory M. Jones, “The Coherence of Natural Inalienable Rights”, UMKC Law Review (2007-\n08), Volume 76 (4), at pages 971-972\n51\nRonald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously, Duckworth (1977)\n52\nIbid, at page xi\n38\nPART G\nas equally entitled to concern and respect, or some other\npersonal value of like consequence.”53 (emphasis supplied)\nDealing with the question whether the Government may abridge the rights of others\nto act when their acts might simply increase the risk, by however slight or speculative\na margin, that some person’s right to life or property will be violated, Dworkin says :\n“But no society that purports to recognize a variety of rights, on the\nground that a man’s dignity or equality may be invaded in a variety\nof ways, can accept such a principle54…\nIf rights make sense, then the degrees of their importance cannot\nbe so different that some count not at all when others are\nmentioned55…\nIf the Government does not take rights seriously, then it does not\ntake law seriously either56…”\nDworkin states that judges should decide how widely an individual’s rights extend. He\nstates:\n“Indeed, the suggestion that rights can be demonstrated by a\nprocess of history rather than by an appeal to principle shows either\na confusion or no real concern about what rights are…\nThis has been a complex argument, and I want to summarize it. Our\nconstitutional system rests on a particular moral theory, namely,\nthat men have moral rights against the state. The different clauses\nof the Bill of Rights, like the due process and equal protection\nclauses, must be understood as appealing to moral concepts rather\nthan laying down particular concepts; therefore, a court that\nundertakes the burden of applying these clauses fully as law must\n53\nIbid, at page 199\n54\nIbid, at page 203\n55\nIbid, at page 204\n56\nIbid, at page 205\n39\nPART H\nbe an activist court, in the sense that it must be prepared to frame\nand answer questions of political morality…”57\nA later section of this judgment deals with how natural and inalienable rights have\nbeen developed in Indian precedent.\nH        Evolution of the privacy doctrine in India\n47       Among the early decisions of this Court following Kharak Singh was R M\nMalkani v State of Maharashtra58\n. In that case, this Court held that\nSection 25\nof\nthe Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 was not violated because :\n“Where a person talking on the telephone allows another person to\nrecord it or to hear it, it cannot be said that the other person who is\nallowed to do so is damaging, removing, tampering, touching\nmachinery battery line or post for intercepting or acquainting himself\nwith the contents of any message. There was no element of\ncoercion or compulsion in attaching the tape recorder to the\ntelephone.”59\nThis Court followed the same line of reasoning as it had in Kharak Singh while\nrejecting a privacy based challenge under\nArticle 21.\nSignificantly, the Court observed\nthat :\n“Article 21 was invoked by submitting that the privacy of the\nappellant’s conversation was invaded.\nArticle 21\ncontemplates\nprocedure established by law with regard to deprivation of life or\npersonal liberty. The telephone conversation of an innocent citizen\nwill be protected by Courts against wrongful or high handed\ninterference by tapping the conversation. The protection is not for\n57\nIbid, at page 147\n58\n(1973) 1 SCC 471\n59\nIbid, at page 476 (para 20)\n40\nPART H\nthe guilty citizen against the efforts of the police to vindicate the law\nand prevent corruption of public servants. It must not be understood\nthat the Court will tolerate safeguards for the protection of the\ncitizen to be imperilled by permitting the police to proceed by\nunlawful or irregular methods.”60\nIn other words, it was the targeted and specific nature of the interception which\nweighed with the Court, the telephone tapping being directed at a guilty person. Hence\nthe Court ruled that the telephone conversation of an innocent citizen will be protected\nagainst wrongful interference by wiretapping.\n48      In Gobind61, a Bench of three judges of this Court considered a challenge to\nthe validity of Regulations 855 and 856 of State Police Regulations under which a\nhistory sheet was opened against the petitioner who had been placed under\nsurveillance. The Bench of three judges adverted to the decision in Kharak Singh\nand to the validation of the Police Regulations (other than domiciliary visits at night).\nBy the time the decision was handed down in Gobind, the law in the US had evolved\nand this Court took note of the decision in Griswold v Connecticut62 (“Griswold”) in\nwhich a conviction under a statute on a charge of giving information and advice to\nmarried persons on contraceptive methods was held to be invalid. This Court adverted\nto the dictum that specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights have penumbras which\ncreate zones of privacy. The Court also relied upon the US Supreme Court decision\nin Jane Roe v Henry Wade63 in which the Court upheld the right of a married woman\n60\nIbid, at page 479 (para 31)\n61\n(1975) 2 SCC 148\n62\n381 US 479 (1965)\n63\n410 US 113 (1973)\n41\nPART H\nto terminate her pregnancy as a part of the right of personal privacy. The following\nobservations of Justice Mathew, who delivered the judgment of the Court do indicate\na constitutional recognition of the right to be let alone :\n“There can be no doubt that the makers of our Constitution wanted\nto ensure conditions favourable to the pursuit of happiness. They\ncertainly realized as Brandeis, J. said in his dissent in Olmstead v.\nUnited States64, the significance of man’s spiritual nature, of his\nfeelings and of his intellect and that only a part of the pain, pleasure,\nsatisfaction of life can be found in material things and therefore,\nthey must be deemed to have conferred upon the individual as\nagainst the government a sphere where he should be let alone”.65\nThese observations follow upon a reference to the Warren and Brandeis article; the\ntwo decisions of the US Supreme Court noted earlier; the writings of Locke and Kant;\nand to dignity, liberty and autonomy.\n49         Yet a close reading of the decision in Gobind would indicate that the Court\neventually did not enter a specific finding on the existence of a right to privacy under\nthe Constitution. The Court indicated that if the Court does find that a particular right\nshould be protected as a fundamental privacy right, it could be overridden only subject\nto a compelling interest of the State :\n“There can be no doubt that privacy-dignity claims deserve to be\nexamined with care and to be denied only when an important\ncountervailing interest is shown to be superior. If the Court does\nfind that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a\nfundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must satisfy the\ncompelling State interest test. Then the question would be\n64\n277 US 438 (1928)\n65\nSupra note 6, at page 155 (para 20)\n42\nPART H\nwhether a State interest is of such paramount importance as would\njustify an infringement of the right.”66 (emphasis supplied)\nWhile emphasising individual autonomy and the dangers of individual privacy being\neroded by new developments that “will make it possible to be heard in the street what\nis whispered in the closet”, the Court had obvious concerns about adopting a broad\ndefinition of privacy since the right of privacy “is not explicit in the Constitution”.\nObserving that the concept of privacy overlaps with liberty, this Court noted thus :\n“Individual autonomy, perhaps the central concern of any system of\nlimited government, is protected in part under our Constitution by\nexplicit constitutional guarantees. In the application of the\nConstitution our contemplation cannot only be of what has been but\nwhat may be. Time works changes and brings into existence\nnew conditions. Subtler and far reaching means of invading\nprivacy will make it possible to be heard in the street what is\nwhispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a definition of privacy\nraises serious questions about the propriety of judicial\nreliance on a right that is not explicit in the Constitution. Of\ncourse, privacy primarily concerns the individual. It therefore\nrelates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty. The most serious\nadvocate of privacy must confess that there are serious problems\nof defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in\nautonomy must also be placed in the context of other rights and\nvalues.”67 (emphasis supplied)\nJustice Mathew proceeded to explain what any right of privacy must encompass and\nprotect and found it to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty :\n“Any right to privacy must encompass and protect the personal\nintimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood,\nprocreation and child rearing. This catalogue approach to the\nquestion is obviously not as instructive as it does not give an\nanalytical picture of the distinctive characteristics of the right of\n66\nIbid, at page 155 (para 22)\n67\nIbid, at page 156 (para 23)\n43\nPART H\nprivacy. Perhaps, the only suggestion that can be offered as\nunifying principle underlying the concept has been the assertion\nthat a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty.”68\nIn adverting to ordered liberty, the judgment is similar to the statement in the judgment\nof Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar in Kharak Singh which found the intrusion of the\nhome by nightly domiciliary visits a violation of ordered liberty.\nThe Court proceeded to hold that in any event, the right to privacy will need a case to\ncase elaboration. The following observations were carefully crafted to hold that even\non the “assumption” that there is an independent right of privacy emanating from\npersonal liberty, the right to movement and free speech, the right is not absolute:\n“The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through\na process of case-by-case development. Therefore, even\nassuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move\nfreely throughout the territory of India and the freedom of\nspeech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation\nfrom them which one can characterize as a fundamental right, we\ndo      not     think     that    the      right     is    absolute.”69\n(emphasis supplied)\nAgain a similar “assumption” was made by the Court in the following observations:\n“…Assuming that the fundamental rights explicitly guaranteed to a\ncitizen have penumbral zones and that the right to privacy is itself a\nfundamental right, that fundamental right must be subject to\nrestriction on the basis of compelling public interest. As Regulation\n856 has the force of law, it cannot be said that the fundamental right\nof the petitioner under\nArticle 21\nhas been violated by the provisions\n68\nIbid, at page 156 (para 24)\n69\nIbid, at page 157 (para 28)\n44\nPART H\ncontained in it : for, what is guaranteed under that Article is that no\nperson shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by the\nprocedure established by ‘law’. We think that the procedure is\nreasonable having regard to the provisions of Regulations 853 (c)\nand 857.”70 (emphasis supplied)\nThe Court declined to interfere with the regulations.\n50         The judgment in Gobind does not contain a clear statement of principle by the\nCourt of the existence of an independent right of privacy or of such a right being an\nemanation from explicit constitutional guarantees. The Bench, which consisted of\nthree judges, may have been constrained by the dictum in the latter part of Kharak\nSingh. Whatever be the reason, it is evident that in several places Justice Mathew\nproceeded on the “assumption” that if the right to privacy is protected under the\nConstitution, it is a part of ordered liberty and is not absolute but subject to restrictions\ntailor-made to fulfil a compelling state interest. This analysis of the decision in Gobind\nassumes significance because subsequent decisions of smaller Benches have\nproceeded on the basis that Gobind does indeed recognise a right to privacy. What\nthe contours of such a right are, emerges from a reading of those decisions. This is\nthe next aspect to which we now turn.\n51         Malak Singh v State of Punjab and Haryana71 (“Malak Singh”) dealt with the\nprovisions of\nSection 23\nof the Punjab Police Rules under which a surveillance register\n70\nIbid, at page 157-158 (para 31)\n71\n(1981) 1 SCC 420\n45\nPART H\nwas to be maintained among other persons, of all convicts of a particular description\nand persons who were reasonably believed to be habitual offenders whether or not,\nthey were convicted. The validity of the rules was not questioned in view of the\ndecisions in Kharak Singh and Gobind.               The rules provided for modalities of\nsurveillance. Justice O Chinnappa Reddy speaking for a Bench of two judges of this\nCourt recognised the need for surveillance on habitual and potential offenders. In his\nview:\n“Prevention of crime is one of the prime purposes of the constitution\nof a police force. The preamble to the\nPolice Act, 1861\nsays:\n“Whereas it is expedient to reorganise the police and to make it a\nmore efficient instrument for the prevention and detection of crime.”\nSection 23\nof the Police Act prescribes it as the duty of police\nofficers “to collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public\npeace; to prevent the commission of offences and public\nnuisances”. In connection with these duties it will be necessary to\nkeep discreet surveillance over reputed bad characters, habitual\noffenders and other potential offenders. Organised crime cannot be\nsuccessfully fought without close watch of suspects. But,\nsurveillance may be intrusive and it may so seriously encroach\non the privacy of a citizen as to infringe his fundamental right\nto personal liberty guaranteed by\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution\nand the freedom of movement guaranteed by\nArticle 19(1)(d).\nThat\ncannot be permitted. This is recognised by the Punjab Police Rules\nthemselves. Rule 23.7, which prescribes the mode of surveillance,\npermits the close watch over the movements of the person under\nsurveillance but without any illegal interference. Permissible\nsurveillance is only to the extent of a close watch over the\nmovements of the person under surveillance and no more. So long\nas surveillance is for the purpose of preventing crime and is\nconfined to the limits prescribed by Rule 23.7 we do not think a\nperson whose name is included in the surveillance register can\nhave a genuine cause for complaint. We may notice here that\ninterference in accordance with law and for the prevention of\ndisorder and crime is an exception recognised even by European\nConvention of Human Rights to the right to respect for a person's\nprivate and family life.\nArticle 8\nof the Convention reads as follows:\n46\nPART H\n“(1) Everyone's right to respect for his private and\nfamily life, his home and his correspondence shall be\nrecognised.\n(2) There shall be no interference by a public authority\nwith the exercise of this right, except such as is in\naccordance with law and is necessary in a democratic\nsociety in the interests of national security, public\nsafety, for the prevention of disorder and crime or for\nthe protection of health or morals.””72      (emphasis\nsupplied)\nThe Court did not consider it unlawful for the police to conduct surveillance so long as\nit was for the purpose of preventing crime and was confined to the limits prescribed\nby Rule 23.7 which, while authorising a close watch on the movement of a person\nunder surveillance, contained a condition that this should be without any illegal\ninterference. The object being to prevent crime, the Court held that the person who\nis subject to surveillance is not entitled to access the register nor was a pre-decisional\nhearing compliant with natural justice warranted. Confidentiality, this Court held, was\nrequired in the interest of the public, including keeping in confidence the sources of\ninformation. Again the Court held:\n“But all this does not mean that the police have a licence to enter\nthe names of whoever they like (dislike?) in the surveillance\nregister; nor can the surveillance be such as to squeeze the\nfundamental freedoms guaranteed to all citizens or to obstruct the\nfree exercise and enjoyment of those freedoms; nor can the\nsurveillance so intrude as to offend the dignity of the individual.\nSurveillance of persons who do not fall within the categories\nmentioned in Rule 23.4 or for reasons unconnected with the\nprevention of crime, or excessive surveillance falling beyond the\nlimits prescribed by the rules, will entitle a citizen to the court's\nprotection which the court will not hesitate to give. The very Rules\n72\nIbid, at pages 424-425 (para 6)\n47\nPART H\nwhich prescribe the conditions for making entries in the surveillance\nregister and the mode of surveillance appear to recognise the\ncaution and care with which the police officers are required to\nproceed. The note following Rule 23.4 is instructive. It enjoins a duty\nupon the police officer to construe the rule strictly and confine the\nentries in the surveillance register to the class of persons mentioned\nin the rule. Similarly Rule 23.7 demands that there should be no\nillegal interference in the guise of surveillance. Surveillance,\ntherefore, has to be unobtrusive and within bounds.”73\nThe observations in Malak Singh on the issue of privacy indicate that an\nencroachment on privacy infringes personal liberty under\nArticle 21\nand the right to\nthe freedom of movement under\nArticle 19(1)(d).\nWithout specifically holding that\nprivacy is a protected constitutional value under\nArticle 19\nor\nArticle 21\n, the judgment\nof this Court indicates that serious encroachments on privacy impinge upon personal\nliberty and the freedom of movement. The Court linked such an encroachment with\nthe dignity of the individual which would be offended by surveillance bereft of\nprocedural protections and carried out in a manner that would obstruct the free\nexercise of freedoms guaranteed by the fundamental rights.\n52\nState of Maharashtra v Madhukar Narayan Mardikar74\nis another decision by\na two-judge Bench which dealt with a case of a police inspector who was alleged to\nhave attempted to have non-consensual intercourse with a woman by entering the\nhutment where she lived. Following an enquiry, he was dismissed from service but\nthe punishment was modified, in appeal, to removal so as to enable him to apply for\n73\nIbid, at page 426 (para 9)\n74\n(1991) 1 SCC 57\n48\nPART H\npensionary benefits. The High Court quashed the punishment both on the ground of\na violation of the principles of natural justice, and by questioning the character of the\nvictim. Holding that this approach of the High Court was misconceived, Justice A M\nAhmadi (as the learned Chief Justice then was) held that though the victim had\nadmitted “the dark side of her life”, she was yet entitled to her privacy :\n“The High Court observes that since Banubi is an unchaste woman\nit would be extremely unsafe to allow the fortune and career of a\ngovernment official to be put in jeopardy upon the uncorroborated\nversion of such a woman who makes no secret of her illicit intimacy\nwith another person. She was honest enough to admit the dark side\nof her life. Even a woman of easy virtue is entitled to privacy\nand no one can invade her privacy as and when he likes. So\nalso it is not open to any and every person to violate her\nperson as and when he wishes. She is entitled to protect her\nperson if there is an attempt to violate it against her wish. She\nis equally entitled to the protection of law. Therefore, merely\nbecause she is a woman of easy virtue, her evidence cannot\nbe thrown overboard. At the most the officer called upon to\nevaluate her evidence would be required to administer caution unto\nhimself before accepting her evidence.”75 (emphasis supplied)\nAs the above extract indicates, the issue before this Court was essentially based on\nthe appreciation of the evidence of the victim by the High Court. However, the\nobservations of this Court make a strong statement of the bodily integrity of a woman,\nas an incident of her privacy.\n53         The decision In\nLife Insurance Corporation of India v Prof Manubhai D\nShah76\n,         incorrectly attributed to the decision in Indian Express Newspapers\n75\nIbid, at pages 62-63 (para 8)\n76\n(1992) 3 SCC 637\n49\nPART H\n(Bombay) Pvt Ltd v Union of India77 the principle that the right to free expression\nunder\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nincludes the privacy of communications. The judgment of this\nCourt in Indian Express cited a U N Report but did no more.\n54        The decision which has assumed some significance is Rajagopal78 . In that\ncase, in a proceeding under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution, a writ was sought for\nrestraining the state and prison authorities from interfering with the publication of an\nautobiography of a condemned prisoner in a magazine. The prison authorities, in a\ncommunication to the publisher, denied the claim that the autobiography had been\nauthored by the prisoner while he was confined to jail and opined that a publication in\nthe name of a convict was against prison rules. The prisoner in question had been\nfound guilty of six murders and was sentenced to death. Among the questions which\nwere posed by this Court for decision was whether a citizen could prevent another\nfrom writing about the life story of the former and whether an unauthorized publication\ninfringes the citizen’s right to privacy. Justice Jeevan Reddy speaking for a Bench of\ntwo judges recognised that the right of privacy has two aspects: the first affording an\naction in tort for damages resulting from an unlawful invasion of privacy, while the\nsecond is a constitutional right. The judgment traces the constitutional protection of\nprivacy to the decisions in Kharak Singh and Gobind. This appears from the\nfollowing observations:\n77\n(1985) 1 SCC 641\n78\n(1994) 6 SCC 632\n50\nPART H\n“…The first decision of this Court dealing with this aspect is\nKharak\nSingh v. State of U.P.\n[(1964) 1 SCR 332 : AIR 1963 SC 1295 :\n(1963) 2 Cri LJ 329] A more elaborate appraisal of this right took\nplace in a later decision in Gobind v.State of M.P.[(1975) 2 SCC\n148 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 468] wherein Mathew, J. speaking for himself,\nKrishna Iyer and Goswami, JJ. traced the origins of this right and\nalso pointed out how the said right has been dealt with by the United\nStates Supreme Court in two of its well-known decisions\nin Griswold v. Connecticut [381 US 479 : 14 L Ed 2d 510 (1965)]\nand Roe v. Wade [410 US 113 : 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973)]…”79\nThe decision in Rajagopal considers the decisions in Kharak Singh and Gobind thus:\n“… Kharak Singh [(1964) 1 SCR 332 : AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1963)\n2 Cri LJ 329] was a case where the petitioner was put under\nsurveillance as defined in Regulation 236 of the U.P. Police\nRegulations…\nThough right to privacy was referred to, the decision turned on the\nmeaning and content of “personal liberty” and “life” in Article\n21. Gobind [(1975) 2 SCC 148 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 468] was also a\ncase of surveillance under M.P. Police Regulations. Kharak\nSingh [(1964) 1 SCR 332 : AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 329]\nwas followed even while at the same time elaborating the right to\nprivacy…”80\nThe Court held that neither the State nor its officials can impose prior restrictions on\nthe publication of an autobiography of a convict. In the course of its summary of the\ndecision, the Court held:\n79\nIbid, at pages 639-640 (para 9)\n80\nIbid, at page 643 (para 13)\n51\nPART H\n“(1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed to the citizens of this country by\nArticle 21.\nIt is a “right\nto be let alone”. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his\nhome, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing\nand education among other matters. None can publish anything\nconcerning the above matters without his consent — whether\ntruthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so,\nhe would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned\nand would be liable in an action for damages. Position may,\nhowever, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into\ncontroversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\npublication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes\nunobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records\nincluding court records. This is for the reason that once a matter\nbecomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\nsubsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press\nand media among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in\nthe interests of decency [\nArticle 19(2)]\nan exception must be carved\nout to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault,\nkidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected\nto the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in\npress/media.\n(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above — indeed,\nthis is not an exception but an independent rule. In the case of\npublic officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the\nremedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect\nto their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official\nduties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts\nand statements which are not true, unless the official establishes\nthat the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless\ndisregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the\ndefendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted\nafter a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for\nhim to prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the\npublication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or personal\nanimosity, the defendant would have no defence and would be\nliable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant\nto the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same\nprotection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It\nneeds no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power\nto punish for contempt of court and Parliament and legislatures\nprotected as their privileges are by\nArticles 105\nand\n104\n52\nPART H\nrespectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions to this\nrule…”81\n55      The judgment of Justice Jeevan Reddy regards privacy as implicit in the right\nto life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21.\nIn coming to the conclusion, the judgment\nin Rajagopal notes that while Kharak Singh had referred to the right of privacy, the\ndecision turned on the content of life and personal liberty in\nArticle 21.\nThe decision\nrecognises privacy as a protected constitutional right, while tracing it to\nArticle 21.\n56       In an interesting research article on ‘State’s surveillance and the right to\nprivacy’, a contemporary scholar has questioned the theoretical foundation of the\ndecision in Rajagopal on the ground that the case essentially dealt with cases in the\nUS concerning privacy against governmental intrusion which was irrelevant in the\nfactual situation before this Court.82 In the view of the author, Rajagopal involved a\npublication of an article by a private publisher in a magazine, authored by a private\nindividual, albeit a convict. Hence the decision has been criticized on the ground that\nRajagopal was about an action between private parties and, therefore, ought to have\ndealt with privacy in the context of tort law. 83 While it is true that in Rajagopal it is a\nprivate publisher who was seeking to publish an article about a death row convict, it\nis equally true that the Court dealt with a prior restraint on publication imposed by the\n81\nIbid, at pages 649-650 (para 26)\n82\nGautam Bhatia, “State Surveillance and the Right to Privacy in India: A Constitutional Biography”, National\nLaw School of India Review (2014), Vol. 26(2), at pages 138-139\n83\nIbid\n53\nPART H\nstate and its prison officials. That is, in fact, how\nArticle 32\nwas invoked by the\npublisher.\n57        The intersection between privacy and medical jurisprudence has been dealt\nwith in a series of judgments of this Court, among them being\nMr X v Hospital Z84\n.\nIn that case, the appellant was a doctor in the health service of a state. He was\naccompanying a patient for surgery from Nagaland to Chennai and was tested when\nhe was to donate blood. The blood sample was found to be HIV+. The appellant\nclaiming to have been socially ostracized by the disclosure of his HIV+ status by the\nhospital, filed a claim for damages before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal\nCommission (NCDRC) alleging that the hospital had unauthorizedly disclosed his HIV\nstatus resulting in his marriage being called off and in social opprobrium. Justice\nSaghir Ahmad, speaking for a Bench of two judges of this Court, adverted to the duty\nof the doctor to maintain secrecy in relation to the patient but held that there is an\nexception to the rule of confidentiality where public interest will override that duty. The\njudgment of this Court dwelt on the right of privacy under\nArticle 21\nand other\nprovisions of the Constitution relating to the fundamental rights and the Directive\nPrinciples:\n“Right to privacy has been culled out of the provisions of\nArticle 21\nand other provisions of the Constitution relating to the Fundamental\nRights read with the Directive Principles of State Policy. It was in\nthis context that it was held by this Court in\nKharak Singh v. State\nof U.P.\n[AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1964) 1 SCR 332] that police\nsurveillance of a person by domiciliary visits would be violative of\n84\n(1998) 8 SCC 296\n54\nPART H\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution.\nThis decision was considered by\nMathew, J. in his classic judgment in\nGobind v. State of\nM.P.\n[(1975) 2 SCC 148 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 468] in which the origin\nof “right to privacy” was traced and a number of American decisions,\nincluding Munn v. Illinois [94 US 113 : 24 L Ed 77 (1877)]\n, Wolf v. Colorado [338 US 25 : 93 L Ed 1782 (1949)] and various\narticles were considered…”85\nThe Court read the decision in Malak Singh as reiterating the view taken earlier, on\nprivacy in Kharak Singh and Gobind. The Court proceeded to rely on the decision\nin Rajagopal. The Court held that the right to privacy is not absolute and is subject to\naction lawfully taken to prevent crime or disorder or to protect the health, morals and\nthe rights and freedoms of others. Public disclosure of even true facts, the Court held,\nmay amount to invasion of the right to privacy or the right to be let alone when a doctor\nbreaches confidentiality. The Court held that:\n“Disclosure of even true private facts has the tendency to disturb a\nperson's tranquillity. It may generate many complexes in him and\nmay even lead to psychological problems. He may, thereafter, have\na disturbed life all through. In the face of these potentialities, and as\nalready held by this Court in its various decisions referred to above,\nthe right of privacy is an essential component of the right to life\nenvisaged by\nArticle 21.\nThe right, however, is not absolute and\nmay be lawfully restricted for the prevention of crime, disorder or\nprotection of health or morals or protection of rights and freedom of\nothers.”86\nHowever, the disclosure that the appellant was HIV+ was held not to be violative of\nthe right to privacy of the appellant on the ground that the woman to whom he was to\n85\nIbid, at page 305 (para 21)\n86\nIbid, at page 307 (para 28)\n55\nPART H\nbe married “was saved in time by such disclosure and from the risk of being infected”.\nThe denial of a claim for compensation by the NCDRC was upheld.\n58        The decision in\nMr X v Hospital Z\nfails to adequately appreciate that the latter\npart of the decision in Kharak Singh declined to accept privacy as a constitutional\nright, while the earlier part invalidated domiciliary visits in the context of an invasion\nof ‘ordered liberty’. Similarly, several observations in Gobind proceed on an\nassumption: if there is a right of privacy, it would comprehend certain matters and\nwould be subject to a regulation to protect compelling state interests.\n59        In a decision of a Bench of two judges of this Court in PUCL87, the Court dealt\nwith telephone tapping. The petitioner challenged the constitutional validity of\nSection\n5(2)\nof the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and urged in the alternative for adopting\nprocedural safeguards to curb arbitrary acts of telephone tapping.\nSection 5(2)\nauthorises the interception of messages in transmission in the following terms:\n“On the occurrence of any public emergency, or in the interest of\nthe public safety, the Central Government or a State Government\nor any officer specially unauthorised in this behalf by the Central\nGovernment or a State Government may, if satisfied that it is\nnecessary or expedient so to do in the interests of the sovereignty\nand integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with\nforeign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the\ncommission of an offence, for reasons to be recorded in writing, by\norder, direct that any message or class of messages to or from any\nperson or class of persons, or relating to any particular subject,\nbrought for transmission by or transmitted or received by any\n87\n(1997) 1 SCC 301\n56\nPART H\ntelegraph, shall not be transmitted, or shall be intercepted or\ndetained, or shall be disclosed to the Government making the order\nor an officer thereof mentioned in the order:\nProvided that press messages intended to be published in India of\ncorrespondents accredited to the Central Government or a State\nGovernment shall not be intercepted or detained, unless their\ntransmission has been prohibited under this sub-section.”\n60         The submission on the invalidity of the statutory provision authorising telephone\ntapping was based on the right to privacy being a fundamental right under\nArticles\n19(1)\nand\n21\nof the Constitution. Justice Kuldip Singh adverted to the observations\ncontained in the majority judgment in Kharak Singh which led to the invalidation of\nthe provision for domiciliary visits at night under Regulation 236(b). PUCL cited the\nminority view of Justice Subba Rao as having gone even further by invalidating\nRegulation 236, in its entirety. The judgment, therefore, construes both the majority\nand minority judgments as having affirmed the right to privacy as a part of\nArticle 21:\n“Article 21 of the Constitution has, therefore, been interpreted by all\nthe seven learned Judges in Kharak Singh case [(1964) 1 SCR 332\n: AIR 1963 SC 1295] (majority and the minority opinions) to include\nthat “right to privacy” as a part of the right to “protection of life and\npersonal liberty” guaranteed under the said Article.”88\nGobind was construed to have upheld the validity of State Police Regulations\nproviding surveillance on the ground that the ‘procedure established by law’ under\nArticle 21\nhad not been violated. After completing its summation of precedents,\nJustice Kuldip Singh held as follows:\n88\nIbid, at page 310 (para 14)\n57\nPART H\n“We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that right to privacy is\na part of the right to “life” and “personal liberty” enshrined under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. Once the facts in a given case\nconstitute a right to privacy,\nArticle 21\nis attracted. The said right\ncannot be curtained “except according to procedure established by\nlaw”.”89\nTelephone conversations were construed to be an important ingredient of privacy and\nthe tapping of such conversations was held to infringe\nArticle 21\n, unless permitted by\n‘procedure established by law’ :\n“The right to privacy — by itself — has not been identified under the\nConstitution. As a concept it may be too broad and moralistic to\ndefine it judicially. Whether right to privacy can be claimed or has\nbeen infringed in a given case would depend on the facts of the said\ncase. But the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy\nof one's home or office without interference can certainly be claimed\nas “right to privacy”. Conversations on the telephone are often of an\nintimate and confidential character. Telephone conversation is a\npart of modern man's life. It is considered so important that more\nand more people are carrying mobile telephone instruments in their\npockets. Telephone conversation is an important facet of a man's\nprivate life. Right to privacy would certainly include telephone\nconversation in the privacy of one's home or office. Telephone-\ntapping would, thus, infract\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India\nunless it is permitted under the procedure established by law.”90\nThe Court also held that telephone tapping infringes the guarantee of free speech and\nexpression under\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nunless authorized by\nArticle 19(2).\nThe judgment\nrelied on the protection of privacy under\nArticle 17\nof the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights (and a similar guarantee under\nArticle 12\nof the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights) which, in its view, must be an interpretative tool for\n89\nIbid, at page 311 (para 17)\n90\nIbid, at page 311 (para 18)\n58\nPART H\nconstruing the provisions of the Constitution.\nArticle 21\n, in the view of the Court, has\nto be interpreted in conformity with international law. In the absence of rules providing\nfor the precautions to be adopted for preventing improper interception and/or\ndisclosure of messages, the fundamental rights under\nArticles 19(1)(a)\nand\n21\ncould\nnot be safeguarded. But the Court was not inclined to require prior judicial scrutiny\nbefore intercepting telephone conversations. The Court ruled that it would be\nnecessary to lay down procedural safeguards for the protection of the right to privacy\nof a person until Parliament intervened by framing rules under\nSection 7\nof the\nTelegraph Act. The Court accordingly framed guidelines to be adopted in all cases\nenvisaging telephone tapping.\n61    The judgment in PUCL construes the earlier decisions in Kharak Singh\n(especially the majority view on the invalidity of domiciliary visits), Gobind and\nRajagopal in holding that the right to privacy is embodied as a constitutionally\nprotected right under\nArticle 21.\nThe Court was conscious of the fact that the right to\nprivacy has “by itself” not been identified under the Constitution. The expression “by\nitself” may indicate one of two meanings. The first is that the Constitution does not\nrecognise a standalone right to privacy. The second recognizes that there is no\nexpress delineation of such a right. Evidently, the Court left the evolution of the\ncontours of the right to a case by case determination. Telephone conversations from\nthe home or office were construed to be an integral element of the privacy of an\nindividual. In PUCL, the Court consciously established the linkages between various\narticles conferring guarantees of fundamental rights when it noted that wire-tapping\n59\nPART H\ninfringes privacy and in consequence the right to life and personal liberty under\nArticle\n21\nand the freedom of speech and expression under\nArticle 19(1)(a).\nThe need to\nread the fundamental constitutional guarantees with a purpose illuminated by India’s\ncommitment to the international regime of human rights’ protection also weighed in\nthe decision.\nSection 5(2)\nof the Telegraph Act was to be regulated by rules framed\nby the Government to render the modalities of telephone tapping fair, just and\nreasonable under\nArticle 21.\nThe importance which the Court ascribes to privacy is\nevident from the fact that it did not await the eventual formulation of rules by\nParliament and prescribed that in the meantime, certain procedural safeguards which\nit envisaged should be put into place.\n62       While dealing with a case involving the rape of an eight year old child, a three-\njudge Bench of this Court in\nState of Karnataka v Krishnappa91\nheld:\n“Sexual violence apart from being… dehumanising… is an unlawful\nintrusion of the right to privacy and sanctity… It… offends her…\ndignity.”92\nSimilar observations were made in\nSudhansu Sekhar Sahoo v State of Orissa93\n.\n63       In\nSharda v Dharmpal94\n, the appellant and respondent were spouses. The\nrespondent sued for divorce and filed an application for conducting a medical\nexamination of the appellant which was opposed.               The Trial Court allowed the\n91\n(2000) 4 SCC 75\n92\nIbid, at page 82 (para 15)\n93\n(2002) 10 SCC 743\n94\n(2003) 4 SCC 493\n60\nPART H\napplication. The High Court dismissed the challenge in a Civil Revision which led the\nappellant to move this Court. The appellant argued before this Court that compelling\nher to undergo a medical examination violated her personal liberty under\nArticle 21\nand that in the absence of an empowering provision, the matrimonial Court had no\njurisdiction to compel a party to undergo a medical examination. Justice S B Sinha,\nspeaking for the Bench of three judges, dealt with the first aspect of the matter\n(whether a matrimonial Court has jurisdiction to order a medical examination) in the\nfollowing terms:\n“Even otherwise the court may issue an appropriate direction so as\nto satisfy itself as to whether apart from treatment he requires\nadequate protection inter alia by way of legal aid so that he may not\nbe subject to an unjust order because of his incapacity. Keeping in\nview of the fact that in a case of mental illness the court has\nadequate power to examine the party or get him examined by a\nqualified doctor, we are of the opinion that in an appropriate case\nthe court may take recourse to such a procedure even at the\ninstance of the party to the lis95…\nFurthermore, the court must be held to have the requisite power\neven under\nSection 151\nof the Code of Civil Procedure to issue\nsuch direction either suo motu or otherwise which, according to him,\nwould lead to the truth.96”\n64         The second question considered by the Court was whether a compulsive\nsubjecting of a person to a medical examination violates\nArticle 21.\nAfter noticing the\nobservations in M P Sharma and Kharak Singh where it was held that the\nConstitution has not guaranteed the right of privacy, the Court held that in subsequent\ndecisions, such a right has been read into\nArticle 21\non an expansive interpretation of\n95\nIbid, at page 513 (para 52)\n96\nIbid, at page 513 (para 53)\n61\nPART H\npersonal liberty. In the course of its judgment, the Court adverted to the decisions in\nRajagopal, PUCL, Gobind and Mr X v Hospital Z on the basis of which it stated that\nit had “outlined the law relating to privacy in India”. In the view of this Court, in\nmatrimonial cases where a decree of divorce is sought on medical grounds, a medical\nexamination is the only way in which an allegation could be proved. In such a situation:\n“If the respondent avoids such medical examination on the ground\nthat it violates his/her right to privacy or for that matter right to\npersonal liberty as enshrined under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of\nIndia, then it may in most of such cases become impossible to arrive\nat a conclusion. It may render the very grounds on which divorce is\npermissible nugatory. Therefore, when there is no right to privacy\nspecifically conferred by\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India and\nwith the extensive interpretation of the phrase “personal liberty” this\nright has been read into\nArticle 21\n, it cannot be treated as an\nabsolute right…”97\nThe right of privacy was held not to be breached.\n65         In\nDistrict Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad v Canara Bank98 (“Canara\nBank”\n), a Bench of two judges of this Court considered the provisions of the\nIndian\nStamp Act, 1899\n(as amended by a special law in Andhra Pradesh). Section 73, which\nwas invalidated by the High Court, empowered the Collector to inspect registers,\nbooks and records, papers, documents and proceedings in the custody of any public\nofficer ‘to secure any duty or to prove or would lead to the discovery of a fraud or\nomission’. Section 73 was in the following terms:\n97\nIbid, at page 523 (para 76)\n98\n(2005) 1 SCC 496\n62\nPART H\n“73. Every public officer having in his custody any registers, books,\nrecords, papers, documents or proceedings, the inspection whereof\nmay tend to secure any duty, or to prove or lead to the discovery of\nany fraud or omission in relation to any duty, shall at all reasonable\ntimes permit any person authorised in writing by the Collector to\ninspect for such purpose the registers, books, papers, documents\nand proceedings, and to take such notes and extracts as he may\ndeem necessary, without fee or charge.”\nAfter adverting to the evolution of the doctrine of privacy in the US from a right\nassociated with property99 to a right associated with the individual100, Chief Justice\nLahoti referred to the penumbras created by the Bill of Rights resulting in a zone of\nprivacy101 leading up eventually to a “reasonable expectation of privacy” 102. Chief\nJustice Lahoti considered the decision in M P Sharma to be “of limited help” to the\ndiscussion on privacy. However, it was Kharak Singh which invalidated nightly-\ndomiciliary visits that provided guidance on the issue. The evaluation of Kharak\nSingh was in the following terms:\n“In…Kharak Singh v State of U P [(1964) 1 SCR 332 : (1963) 2\nCri LJ 329] the U.P. Regulations regarding domiciliary visits were in\nquestion and the majority referred to Munn v. Illinois [94 US 113\n: 24 L Ed 77 (1877)] and held that though our Constitution did\nnot refer to the right to privacy expressly, still it can be traced\nfrom the right to “life” in\nArticle 21.\nAccording to the majority,\nclause 236 of the relevant Regulations in U.P., was bad in law; it\noffended\nArticle 21\ninasmuch as there was no law permitting\ninterference by such visits. The majority did not go into the question\nwhether these visits violated the “right to privacy”.\nBut, Subba Rao,\nJ. while concurring that the fundamental right to privacy was part of\nthe right to liberty in\nArticle 21\n, part of the right to freedom of speech\nand expression in\nArticle 19(1)(a)\n, and also of the right to movement\nin\nArticle 19(1)(d)\n, held that the Regulations permitting surveillance\n99\nBoyd v United States, 116 US 616 (1886)\n100\nOlmstead v United States, 277\nUS 438 (1928)\n101\nGriswold v State of Connecticut\n, 381 US 479 (1965)\n102\nKatz v United States, 389 US 347 (1967)\n63\nPART H\nviolated the fundamental right of privacy.\nIn the discussion the\nlearned Judge referred to Wolf v. Colorado [338 US 25 : 93 L Ed\n1782 (1949)] . In effect, all the seven learned Judges held that\nthe “right to privacy” was part of the right to “life” in Article\n21.”103 (emphasis supplied)\nThe decision in Gobind is construed to have implied the right to privacy in\nArticles\n19(1)(a)\nand\n21\nof the Constitution:\n“We have referred in detail to the reasons given by Mathew, J.\nin Gobind to show that, the right to privacy has been implied\nin\nArticles 19(1)(a)\nand (d) and\nArticle 21;\nthat, the right is not\nabsolute and that any State intrusion can be a reasonable\nrestriction only if it has reasonable basis or reasonable materials to\nsupport it.”104      (emphasis supplied)\nThe Court dealt with the application of\nSection 73\nof the Indian Stamp Act (as\namended), to documents of a customer in the possession of a bank. The Court held:\n“Once we have accepted in Gobind [(1975) 2 SCC 148 : 1975 SCC\n(Cri) 468] and in later cases that the right to privacy deals with\n“persons and not places”, the documents or copies of documents of\nthe customer which are in a bank, must continue to remain\nconfidential vis-à-vis the person, even if they are no longer at the\ncustomer's house and have been voluntarily sent to a bank. If that\nbe the correct view of the law, we cannot accept the line\nof Miller [425 US 435 (1976)] in which the Court proceeded on the\nbasis that the right to privacy is referable to the right of “property”\ntheory. Once that is so, then unless there is some probable or\nreasonable cause or reasonable basis or material before the\nCollector for reaching an opinion that the documents in the\npossession of the bank tend to secure any duty or to prove or to\nlead to the discovery of any fraud or omission in relation to any duty,\nthe search or taking notes or extracts therefore, cannot be valid.\nThe above safeguards must necessarily be read into the provision\n103\nSupra Note 95, at page 516 (para 36)\n104\nIbid, at page 518 (para 39)\n64\nPART H\nrelating to search and inspection and seizure so as to save it from\nany unconstitutionality.”105\nHence the Court repudiated the notion that a person who places documents with a\nbank would, as a result, forsake an expectation of confidentiality. In the view of the\nCourt, even if the documents cease to be at a place other than in the custody and\ncontrol of the customer, privacy attaches to persons and not places and hence the\nprotection of privacy is not diluted. Moreover, in the view of the Court, there has to be\na reasonable basis or material for the Collector to form an opinion that the documents\nin the possession of the bank would secure the purpose of investigating into an act of\nfraud or an omission in relation to duty. The safeguards which the Court introduced\nwere regarded as being implicit in the need to make a search of this nature\nreasonable. The second part of the ruling of the Court is equally important for it finds\nfault with a statutory provision which allows an excessive delegation of the power\nconferred upon the Collector to inspect documents. The provision, the Court rules,\nwould allow the customers’ privacy to be breached by non-governmental persons.\nHence the statute, insofar as it allowed the Collector to authorize any person to seek\ninspection, would be unenforceable. In the view of the Court:\n“Secondly, the impugned provision in Section 73 enabling the\nCollector to authorise “any person” whatsoever to inspect, to take\nnotes or extracts from the papers in the public office suffers from\nthe vice of excessive delegation as there are no guidelines in the\nAct and more importantly, the section allows the facts relating to the\ncustomer's privacy to reach non-governmental persons and would,\non that basis, be an unreasonable encroachment into the\ncustomer's rights. This part of Section 73 permitting delegation to\n105\nIbid, at page 523 (para 53)\n65\nPART H\n“any person” suffers from the above serious defects and for that\nreason is, in our view, unenforceable. The State must clearly define\nthe officers by designation or state that the power can be delegated\nto officers not below a particular rank in the official hierarchy, as\nmay be designated by the State.”106\n66         The significance of the judgment in Canara Bank lies first in its reaffirmation of\nthe right to privacy as emanating from the liberties guaranteed by\nArticle 19\nand from\nthe protection of life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21.\nSecondly, the Court finds\nthe foundation for the reaffirmation of this right not only in the judgments in Kharak\nSingh and Gobind and the cases which followed, but also in terms of India’s\ninternational commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)\nand International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Thirdly, the right to\nprivacy is construed as a right which attaches to the person. The significance of this\nis that the right to privacy is not lost as a result of confidential documents or information\nbeing parted with by the customer to the custody of the bank. Fourthly, the Court\nemphasised the need to read procedural safeguards to ensure that the power of\nsearch and seizure of the nature contemplated by Section 73 is not exercised\narbitrarily. Fifthly, access to bank records to the Collector does not permit a delegation\nof those powers by the Collector to a private individual. Hence even when the power\nto inspect and search is validly exercisable by an organ of the state, necessary\nsafeguards would be required to ensure that the information does not travel to\nunauthorised private hands. Sixthly, information provided by an individual to a third\nparty (in that case a bank) carries with it a reasonable expectation that it will be utilised\n106\nIbid, at page 524 (para 54)\n66\nPART H\nonly for the purpose for which it is provided. Parting with information (to the bank)\ndoes not deprive the individual of the privacy interest. The reasonable expectation is\nallied to the purpose for which information is provided. Seventhly, while legitimate\naims of the state, such as the protection of the revenue may intervene to permit a\ndisclosure to the state, the state must take care to ensure that the information is not\naccessed by a private entity. The decision in Canara Bank has thus important\nconsequences for recognising informational privacy.\n67      After the decision in Canara Bank, the provisions for search and seizure under\nSection 132(5)\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 were construed strictly by this Court in\nP\nR Metrani v Commissioner of Income Tax107\non the ground that they constitute a\n“serious intrusion into the privacy of a citizen”.\nSimilarly, the search and seizure\nprovisions of Sections 42 and 43 of the NDPS108 Act were construed by this Court in\nDirectorate of Revenue v Mohd Nisar Holia109\n. Adverting to Canara Bank, among\nother decisions, the Court held that the right to privacy is crucial and imposes a\nrequirement of a written recording of reasons before a search and seizure could be\ncarried out.\n68\nSection 30\nof the Punjab Excise Act, 1914 prohibited the employment of “any\nman under the age of 25 years” or “any woman” in any part of the premises in which\n107\n(2007) 1 SCC 789\n108\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985\n109\n(2008) 2 SCC 370\n67\nPART H\nliquor or an intoxicating drug is consumed by the public. The provision was also\nchallenged in\nAnuj Garg v Hotel Association of India110\non the ground that it violates\nthe right to privacy. While holding that the provision is ultra vires, the two-judge Bench\nobserved:\n“Privacy rights prescribe autonomy to choose profession\nwhereas security concerns texture methodology of delivery of this\nassurance. But it is a reasonable proposition that that the measures\nto safeguard such a guarantee of autonomy should not be so strong\nthat the essence of the guarantee is lost. State protection must not\ntranslate into censorship111…\nInstead of prohibiting women employment in the bars altogether the\nstate should focus on factoring in ways through which unequal\nconsequences of sex differences can be eliminated. It is state’s duty\nto ensure circumstances of safety which inspire confidence in\nwomen to discharge the duty freely in accordance to the\nrequirements of the profession they choose to follow. Any other\npolicy inference (such as the one embodied under\nSection 30\n)\nfrom societal conditions would be oppressive on the women\nand against the privacy rights112…\nThe Court’s task is to determine whether the measures\nfurthered by the State in form of legislative mandate, to\naugment the legitimate aim of protecting the interests of\nwomen are proportionate to the other bulk of well-settled\ngender norms such as autonomy, equality of opportunity, right\nto privacy et al.113” (emphasis supplied)\n69      In\nHinsa Virodhak Sangh v Mirzapur Moti Kuresh Jamat114 (“Hinsa\nVirodhak Sangh”\n), this Court dealt with the closure of municipal slaughterhouses in\nthe city of Ahmedabad for a period of nine days each year during the Jain observance\n110\n(2008) 3 SCC 1\n111\nIbid, at page 15 (para 35)\n112\nIbid, at pages 16-17 (para 43)\n113\nIbid, at page 19 (para 51)\n114\n(2008) 5 SCC 33\n68\nPART H\nof paryushan, pursuant to the resolution of the municipal corporation. The High Court\nhad set aside the resolutions. In appeal, this Court observed as follows:\n“Had the impugned resolutions ordered closure of municipal\nslaughterhouses for a considerable period of time we may have\nheld the impugned resolutions to be invalid being an excessive\nrestriction on the rights of the butchers of Ahmedabad who practise\ntheir profession of meat selling. After all, butchers are practising a\ntrade and it is their fundamental right under\nArticle 19(1)(g)\nof the\nConstitution which is guaranteed to all citizens of India. Moreover,\nit is not a matter of the proprietor of the butchery shop alone. There\nmay be also several workmen therein who may become\nunemployed if the slaughterhouses are closed for a considerable\nperiod of time, because one of the conditions of the licence given\nto the shop-owners is to supply meat regularly in the city of\nAhmedabad and this supply comes from the municipal\nslaughterhouses of Ahmedabad. Also, a large number of people are\nnon-vegetarian and they cannot be compelled to become\nvegetarian for a long period. What one eats is one's personal\naffair and it is a part of his right to privacy which is included in\nArticle 21\nof our Constitution as held by several decisions of\nthis Court.\nIn\nR. Rajagopal v. State of T.N.\n[(1994) 6 SCC 632 :\nAIR 1995 SC 264] (vide SCC para 26 : AIR para 28) this Court held\nthat the right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed by\nArticle 21.\nIt is a “right to be let alone”.” 115\n(emphasis supplied)\nHowever, since the closure of slaughterhouses was for a period of nine days, the\nCourt came to the conclusion that it did not encroach upon the freedom guaranteed\nby\nArticle 19(1)(g).\nThe restriction was held not to be excessive.\n115\nIbid, at pages 46-47 (para 27)\n69\nPART H\n70      The decision in the\nState of Maharashtra v Bharat Shanti Lal Shah116\ndeals\nwith the constitutional validity of Sections 13 to 16 of the Maharashtra Control of\nOrganized Crime Act (MCOCA) which inter alia contains provisions for intercepting\ntelephone and wireless communications. Upholding the provision, the Court\nobserved:\n“The object of MCOCA is to prevent the organised crime and a\nperusal of the provisions of the Act under challenge would indicate\nthat the said law authorises the interception of wire, electronic or\noral communication only if it is intended to prevent the commission\nof an organised crime or if it is intended to collect the evidence to\nthe commission of such an organised crime. The procedures\nauthorising such interception are also provided therein with enough\nprocedural safeguards, some of which are indicated and discussed\nhereinbefore.”117\nThe safeguards that the Court adverts to in the above extract include\nSection 14\n,\nwhich requires details of the organized crime that is being committed or is about to be\ncommitted, before surveillance could be authorized. The requirements also mandate\ndescribing the nature and location of the facilities from which the communication is to\nbe intercepted, the nature of the communication and the identity of the person, if it is\nknown. A statement is also necessary on whether other modes of enquiry or\nintelligence gathering were tried or had failed or why they reasonably appear to be\nunlikely to succeed if tried or whether these would be too dangerous or would likely\nresult in the identification of those connected with the operation. The duration of the\nsurveillance is restricted in time and the provision requires “minimal interception”118.\n116\n(2008) 13 SCC 5\n117\nIbid, at page 28 (para 61)\n118\nGautam Bhatia (supra note 82), at page 148\n70\nPART H\n71        During the course of the last decade, this Court has had occasion to deal with\nthe autonomy of a woman and, as an integral part, her control over the body. Suchita\nSrivastava v Chandigarh Administration119 (“Suchita Srivastava”) arose in the\ncontext of the\nMedical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP) Act, 1971\n. A woman who\nwas alleged to have been raped while residing in a welfare institution run by the\ngovernment was pregnant. The district administration moved the High Court to seek\ntermination of the pregnancy. The High Court directed that the pregnancy be\nterminated though medical experts had opined that the victim had expressed her\nwillingness to bear the child. The High Court had issued this direction without the\nconsent of the woman which was mandated under the statute where the woman is a\nmajor and does not suffer from a mental illness. The woman in this case was found to\nsuffer from a case of mild to moderate mental retardation. Speaking for a Bench of\nthree judges, Chief Justice Balakrishnan held that the reproductive choice of the\nwoman should be respected having regard to the mandate of\nSection 3\n. In the view\nof the Court:\n“There is no doubt that a woman's right to make reproductive\nchoices is also a dimension of “personal liberty” as understood\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India. It is important to\nrecognise that reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate\nas well as to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration\nis that a woman's right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity\nshould be respected. This means that there should be no\nrestriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive choices such\nas a woman's right to refuse participation in sexual activity or\nalternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive methods.\nFurthermore, women are also free to choose birth control methods\nsuch as undergoing sterilisation procedures. Taken to their logical\n119\n(2009) 9 SCC 1\n71\nPART H\nconclusion, reproductive rights include a woman's entitlement\nto carry a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\nsubsequently raise children. However, in the case of pregnant\nwomen there is also a “compelling State interest” in protecting the\nlife of the prospective child. Therefore, the termination of a\npregnancy is only permitted when the conditions specified in the\napplicable statute have been fulfilled. Hence, the provisions of the\nMTP Act, 1971\ncan also be viewed as reasonable restrictions that\nhave been placed on the exercise of reproductive choices.” 120\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe Court noted that the statute requires the consent of a guardian where the woman\nhas not attained majority or is mentally ill. In the view of the Court, there is a distinction\nbetween mental illness and mental retardation and hence the State which was in-\ncharge of the welfare institution was bound to respect the personal autonomy of the\nwoman.\n72         The decision in Suchita Srivastava dwells on the statutory right of a woman\nunder the\nMTP Act\nto decide whether or not to consent to a termination of pregnancy\nand to have that right respected where she does not consent to termination. The\nstatutory recognition of the right is relatable to the constitutional right to make\nreproductive choices which has been held to be an ingredient of personal liberty under\nArticle 21.\nThe Court deduced the existence of such a right from a woman’s right to\nprivacy, dignity and bodily integrity.\n120\nIbid, at page 15 (para 22)\n72\nPART H\n73      In\nBhavesh Jayanti Lakhani v State of Maharashtra121\n, this Court dealt with\na challenge to the validity of an arrest warrant issued by a US court and a red corner\nnotice issued by INTERPOL on the ground that the petitioner had, in violation of an\ninterim custody order, returned to India with the child. The Court did not accept the\nsubmission that the CBI, by coordinating with INTERPOL had breached the\npetitioner’s right of privacy. However, during the course of the discussion, this Court\nheld as follows:\n“Right to privacy is not enumerated as a fundamental right either in\nterms of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India or otherwise. It,\nhowever, by reason of an elaborate interpretation by this Court\nin\nKharak Singh v. State of U.P.\n[AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1964) 1 SCR\n332] was held to be an essential ingredient of “personal liberty”.”122\n“This Court, however, in\nGobind v. State of M.P.\nupon taking an\nelaborate view of the matter in regard to right to privacy vis-à-vis\nthe Madhya Pradesh Police Regulations dealing with surveillance,\nopined that the said Regulations did not violate the “procedure\nestablished by law”. However, a limited fundamental right to privacy\nas emanating from\nArticles 19(1)(a)\n, (d) and\n21\nwas upheld, but the\nsame was held to be not absolute wherefore reasonable restrictions\ncould be placed in terms of clause (5) of Article 19.”123\n74      In\nSelvi v State of Karnataka124 (“Selvi”\n), a Bench of three judges of this Court\ndealt with a challenge to the validity of three investigative techniques: narco-analysis,\npolygraph test (lie-detector test) and Brain Electrical Activation Profile (BEAP) on the\nground that they implicate the fundamental rights under\nArticles 20(3)\nand\n21\nof the\nConstitution. The Court held that the results obtained through an involuntary\n121\n(2009) 9 SCC 551\n122\nIbid, at pages 584-585 (para 102)\n123\nIbid, at page 585 (para 103)\n124\n(2010) 7 SCC 263\n73\nPART H\nadministration of these tests are within the scope of a testimonial, attracting the\nprotective shield of\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution. Chief Justice Balakrishnan\nadverted to the earlier decisions rendered in the context of privacy and noted that thus\nfar, judicial understanding had stressed mostly on the protection of the body and\nphysical actions induced by the state. The Court emphasised that while the right\nagainst self-incrimination is a component of personal liberty under\nArticle 21\n, privacy\nunder the constitution has a meeting point with\nArticle 20(3)\nas well. In the view of\nthe Court:\n“The theory of interrelationship of rights mandates that the right\nagainst self-incrimination should also be read as a component of\n“personal liberty” under\nArticle 21.\nHence, our understanding of the\n“right to privacy” should account for its intersection with\nArticle\n20(3).\nFurthermore, the “rule against involuntary confessions” as\nembodied in\nSections 24\n,\n25\n,\n26\nand\n27\nof the Evidence Act, 1872\nseeks to serve both the objectives of reliability as well as\nvoluntariness of testimony given in a custodial setting. A conjunctive\nreading of\nArticles 20(3)\nand\n21\nof the Constitution along with the\nprinciples of evidence law leads us to a clear answer. We must\nrecognise the importance of personal autonomy in aspects such as\nthe choice between remaining silent and speaking. An individual's\ndecision to make a statement is the product of a private choice and\nthere should be no scope for any other individual to interfere with\nsuch autonomy, especially in circumstances where the person\nfaces exposure to criminal charges or penalties…\nTherefore, it is our considered opinion that subjecting a person to\nthe impugned techniques in an involuntary manner violates the\nprescribed boundaries of privacy. Forcible interference with a\nperson's mental processes is not provided for under any statute and\nit most certainly comes into conflict with the “right against self-\nincrimination”.”125\n125\nIbid, at pages 369-370 (paras 225-226)\n74\nPART H\nIn tracing the right to privacy under\nArticle 20(3)\n, as well as\nArticle 21\n, the decision\nmarks a definite shift away from the M P Sharma rationale. The right not to be\ncompelled to speak or to incriminate oneself when accused of an offence is an\nembodiment of the right to privacy. Selvi indicates how the right to privacy can\nstraddle the ambit of several constitutional rights\n-\nin that case\n,\nArticles 20(3)\nand\n21.\n75    In\nBhabani Prasad Jena v Orissa State Commission\nfor Women126, the Court\nwas considering the question whether the High Court was justified in issuing a\ndirection for a DNA test of a child and the appellant who, according to the mother of\nthe child, was the father. It was held that:\n“In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue before the court,\nthe use of DNA test is an extremely delicate and sensitive aspect.\nOne view is that when modern science gives the means of\nascertaining the paternity of a child, there should not be any\nhesitation to use those means whenever the occasion requires. The\nother view is that the court must be reluctant in the use of such\nscientific advances and tools which result in invasion of right to\nprivacy of an individual and may not only be prejudicial to the rights\nof the parties but may have devastating effect on the child.\nSometimes the result of such scientific test may bastardise an\ninnocent child even though his mother and her spouse were living\ntogether during the time of conception.”127\n76      In\nAmar Singh v Union of India128\n, a Bench of two judges of this Court dealt\nwith a petition under\nArticle 32\nalleging that the fundamental right to privacy of the\n126\n(2010) 8 SCC 633\n127\nIbid, at page 642 (para 21)\n128\n(2011) 7 SCC 69\n75\nPART H\npetitioner was being breached by intercepting his conversations on telephone services\nprovided by a service provider. The Court held:\n“Considering the materials on record, this Court is of the opinion\nthat it is no doubt true that the service provider has to act on an\nurgent basis and has to act in public interest. But in a given case,\nlike the present one, where the impugned communication dated 9-\n11-2005 is full of gross mistakes, the service provider while\nimmediately acting upon the same, should simultaneously verify the\nauthenticity of the same from the author of the document. This\nCourt is of the opinion that the service provider has to act as a\nresponsible agency and cannot act on any communication.\nSanctity and regularity in official communication in such\nmatters must be maintained especially when the service\nprovider is taking the serious step of intercepting the\ntelephone conversation of a person and by doing so is\ninvading the privacy right of the person concerned and which\nis a fundamental right protected under the Constitution, as has\nbeen held by this Court.”129 (emphasis supplied)\n77         In Ram Jethmalani v Union of India130 (“Ram Jethmalani”), a Bench of two\njudges was dealing with a public interest litigation concerned with unaccounted\nmonies and seeking the appointment of a Special Investigating Team to follow and\ninvestigate a money trail. This Court held that the revelation of the details of the bank\naccounts of individuals without the establishment of a prima facie ground of\nwrongdoing would be a violation of the right to privacy. This Court observed thus:\n“Right to privacy is an integral part of right to life. This is a cherished\nconstitutional value, and it is important that human beings be\nallowed domains of freedom that are free of public scrutiny unless\nthey act in an unlawful manner. We understand and appreciate the\nfact that the situation with respect to unaccounted for monies is\n129\nIbid, at page 84 (para 39)\n130\n(2011) 8 SCC 1\n76\nPART H\nextremely grave. Nevertheless, as constitutional adjudicators we\nalways have to be mindful of preserving the sanctity of constitutional\nvalues, and hasty steps that derogate from fundamental rights,\nwhether urged by Governments or private citizens, howsoever well\nmeaning they may be, have to be necessarily very carefully\nscrutinised. The solution for the problem of abrogation of one zone\nof constitutional values cannot be the creation of another zone of\nabrogation of constitutional values…\nThe rights of citizens, to effectively seek the protection of\nfundamental rights, under clause (1) of\nArticle 32\nhave to be\nbalanced against the rights of citizens and persons under\nArticle 21.\nThe latter cannot be sacrificed on the anvil of fervid desire to find\ninstantaneous solutions to systemic problems such as unaccounted\nfor monies, for it would lead to dangerous circumstances, in which\nvigilante investigations, inquisitions and rabble rousing, by masses\nof other citizens could become the order of the day. The right of\ncitizens to petition this Court for upholding of fundamental rights is\ngranted in order that citizens, inter alia, are ever vigilant about the\nfunctioning of the State in order to protect the constitutional project.\nThat right cannot be extended to being inquisitors of fellow citizens.\nAn inquisitorial order, where citizens' fundamental right to\nprivacy is breached by fellow citizens is destructive of social\norder. The notion of fundamental rights, such as a right to\nprivacy as part of right to life, is not merely that the State is\nenjoined from derogating from them. It also includes the\nresponsibility of the State to uphold them against the actions\nof others in the society, even in the context of exercise of\nfundamental rights by those others.”131 (emphasis supplied)\nThe Court held that while the State could access details of the bank accounts of\ncitizens as an incident of its power to investigate and prosecute crime, this would not\nenable a private citizen to compel a citizen to reveal bank accounts to the public at\nlarge.\n131\nIbid, at pages 35-36 (paras 83-84)\n77\nPART H\n78      In\nSanjoy Narayan v High\nCourt of Allahabad132, the two-judge Bench dealt\nwith a contempt petition in respect of publication of an incorrect report in a newspaper\nwhich tarnished the image of the Chief Justice of a High Court. The Court made the\nfollowing observations:\n“The unbridled power of the media can become dangerous if check\nand balance is not inherent in it. The role of the media is to\nprovide to the readers and the public in general with\ninformation and views tested and found as true and correct.\nThis power must be carefully regulated and must reconcile with\na person's fundamental right to privacy.”133 (emphasis supplied)\n79      In Ramlila Maidan Incident v Home Secretary, Union of India134, Justice B\nS Chauhan in a concurring judgment held that:\n“Right to privacy has been held to be a fundamental right of the\ncitizen being an integral part of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India\nby this Court. Illegitimate intrusion into privacy of a person is not\npermissible as right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed under our Constitution. Such a right has been extended\neven to woman of easy virtues as she has been held to be entitled\nto her right of privacy. However, right of privacy may not be absolute\nand in exceptional circumstance particularly surveillance in\nconsonance with the statutory provisions may not violate such a\nright.”135\nIn the view of the Court, privacy and dignity of human life have “always been\nconsidered a fundamental human right of every human being” like other constitutional\nvalues such as free speech. We must also take notice of the construction placed by\n132\n(2011) 13 SCC 155\n133\nIbid, at page 156 (para 6)\n134\n(2012) 5 SCC 1\n135\nIbid, at pages 119-120 (para 312)\n78\nPART H\nthe judgment on the decision in Kharak Singh as having “held that the right to privacy\nis a part of life under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution” and which was reiterated in PUCL.\n80        The judgment of a Bench of two judges of this Court in\nBihar Public Service\nCommission v Saiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi136\ndealt with the provisions of\nSection\n8(1)(g)\nof the Right to Information Act, 2005. A person claiming to be a public-spirited\ncitizen sought information under the statute from the Bihar Public Service Commission\non a range of matters relating to interviews conducted by it on two days. The\ncommission disclosed the information save and except for the names of the interview\nboard. The High Court directed disclosure.\nSection 8(1)(g)\nprovides an exemption\nfrom disclosure of information of the following nature:\n“information, the disclosure of which would endanger the life or\nphysical safety of any person or identify the source of information\nor assistance given in confidence for law enforcement and security\npurposes.”\nJustice Swatanter Kumar, speaking for the Court, held thus:\n“Certain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are\nrequired to be dealt with great confidentiality. The information may\ncome to knowledge of the authority as a result of disclosure by\nothers who give that information in confidence and with complete\nfaith, integrity and fidelity. Secrecy of such information shall be\nmaintained, thus, bringing it within the ambit of fiduciary capacity.\nSimilarly, there may be cases where the disclosure has no\nrelationship to any public activity or interest or it may even\ncause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual. All\nthese protections have to be given their due implementation as they\nspring from statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter\nbetween private interest and public interest. It is a matter\n136\n(2012) 13 SCC 61\n79\nPART H\nwhere a constitutional protection is available to a person with\nregard to the right to privacy. Thus, the public interest has to be\nconstrued while keeping in mind the balance factor between right to\nprivacy and right to information with the purpose sought to be\nachieved and the purpose that would be served in the larger public\ninterest, particularly when both these rights emerge from the\nconstitutional values under the Constitution of India.”137\n(emphasis supplied)\nSignificantly, though the Court was construing the text of a statutory exemption\ncontained in\nSection 8\n, it dwelt on the privacy issues involved in the disclosure of\ninformation furnished in confidence by adverting to the constitutional right to privacy.\n81      The decision\nLillu @Rajesh v State of Haryana138\nemphasized the right of\nrape survivors to privacy, physical and mental integrity and dignity. The Court held\nthus:\n“In view of International Covenant on Economic, Social, and\nCultural Rights 1966; United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles\nof Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power 1985, rape\nsurvivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not retraumatize\nthem or violate their physical or mental integrity and dignity. They\nare also entitled to medical procedures conducted in a manner that\nrespects their right to consent. Medical procedures should not be\ncarried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman, or\ndegrading treatment and health should be of paramount\nconsideration while dealing with gender-based violence. The\nState is under an obligation to make such services available to\nsurvivors of sexual violence. Proper measures should be\ntaken to ensure their safety and there should be no arbitrary or\nunlawful interference with his privacy.”139 (emphasis supplied)\n137\nIbid, at page 74 (para 23)\n138\n(2013) 14 SCC 643\n139\nIbid, at page 648 (para 13)\n80\nPART H\n82         In\nThalappalam Service Cooperative Bank Limited v State of Kerala140,\nanother\nBench of two judges considered the correctness of a decision of the Kerala\nHigh Court which upheld a circular issued by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies.\nBy the circular all cooperative institutions under his administrative control were\ndeclared to be public authorities within the meaning of\nSection 2(h)\nof the Right to\nInformation Act, 2005.\nSection 8(j)\ncontains an exemption from the disclosure of\npersonal information which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or\nwhich would cause “unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual” unless the\nauthority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies its disclosure. This Court\nobserved that the right to privacy has been recognized as a part of\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution and the statutory provisions contained in\nSection 8(j)\nof the RTI Act have\nbeen enacted by the legislature in recognition of the constitutional protection of\nprivacy. The Court held thus:\n“The right to privacy is also not expressly guaranteed under the\nConstitution of India. However, the Privacy Bill, 2011 to provide for\nthe right to privacy to citizens of India and to regulate the collection,\nmaintenance and dissemination of their personal information and\nfor penalisation for violation of such rights and matters connected\ntherewith, is pending.\nIn several judgments including\nKharak\nSingh v.

Dealing with the provisions of\nArticle 75(1)\nof the\nConstitution, Justice Dipak Misra, while explaining the doctrine of “constitutional\nimplications”, considered whether the Court could read a disqualification into the\nprovisions made by the Constitution in addition to those which have been provided by\nthe legislature. In that context, the leading judgment observes:\n“In this regard, inclusion of many a facet within the ambit of\nArticle\n21\nis well established.\nIn\nR. Rajagopal v.

State of Madras\n[AIR 1950 SC 124 : (1950)\n51 Cri LJ 1514] , has observed that freedom of speech and\nexpression includes freedom of propagation of ideas…\nThere is no speck of doubt that the Court has applied the doctrine\nof implication to expand the constitutional concepts, but the context\nin which the horizon has been expanded has to be borne in mind…\n142\nIbid, at page 114 (para 64)\n143\n(2014) 9 SCC 1\n82\nPART H\nAt this juncture, it is seemly to state that the principle of implication\nis fundamentally founded on rational inference of an idea from the\nwords used in the text…\nAny proposition that is arrived at taking this route of interpretation\nmust find some resting pillar or strength on the basis of certain\nwords in the text or the scheme of the text. In the absence of that,\nit may not be permissible for a court to deduce any proposition as\nthat would defeat the legitimacy of reasoning. A proposition can be\nestablished by reading a number of articles cohesively, for that will\nbe in the domain of substantive legitimacy.”144 (emphasis supplied)\n84         In National Legal Services Authority v Union of India145 (“NALSA”), a\nBench of two judges, while dealing with the rights of transgenders, adverted to\ninternational conventions acceded to by India including the UDHR and ICCPR.\nProvisions in these conventions which confer a protection against arbitrary and\nunlawful interference with a person’s privacy, family and home would, it was held, be\nread in a manner which harmonizes the fundamental rights contained in\nArticles 14\n,\n15\n, 19\nand\n21\nwith India’s international obligations. Justice K S Radhakrishnan held\nthat:\n“Gender identity, therefore, lies at the core of one's personal\nidentity, gender expression and presentation and, therefore, it will\nhave to be protected under\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nof the Constitution of\nIndia. A transgender's personality could be expressed by the\ntransgender's behaviour and presentation. State cannot prohibit,\nrestrict or interfere with a transgender's expression of such\npersonality, which reflects that inherent personality. Often the State\nand its authorities either due to ignorance or otherwise fail to digest\nthe innate character and identity of such persons. We, therefore,\nhold that values of privacy, self-identity, autonomy and personal\nintegrity are fundamental rights guaranteed to members of the\ntransgender community under\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nof the Constitution of\n144\nIbid, at pages 47-48 (paras 69-70)\n145\n(2014) 5 SCC 438\n83\nPART H\nIndia and the State is bound to protect and recognise those\nrights.”146\nExplaining the ambit of\nArticle 21\n, the Court noted:\n“Article 21 is the heart and soul of the Indian Constitution, which\nspeaks of the rights to life and personal liberty. Right to life is one\nof the basic fundamental rights and not even the State has the\nauthority to violate or take away that right.\nArticle 21\ntakes all those\naspects of life which go to make a person's life meaningful.\nArticle\n21\nprotects the dignity of human life, one's personal autonomy,\none's right to privacy, etc. Right to dignity has been recognised to\nbe an essential part of the right to life and accrues to all persons on\naccount of being humans.\nIn\nFrancis Coralie Mullin v. UT of\nDelhi\n[(1981) 1 SCC 608 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 212] (SCC pp. 618-19,\nparas 7 and 8), this Court held that the right to dignity forms an\nessential part of our constitutional culture which seeks to ensure the\nfull development and evolution of persons and includes “expressing\noneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and\ncomingling with fellow human beings…147\nArticle 21\n, as already indicated, guarantees the protection of\n“personal autonomy” of an individual.\nIn\nAnuj Garg v. Hotel Assn. of\nIndia\n[(2008) 3 SCC 1] (SCC p. 15, paras 34-35), this Court held\nthat personal autonomy includes both the negative right of not to be\nsubject to interference by others and the positive right of individuals\nto make decisions about their life, to express themselves and to\nchoose which activities to take part in. Self-determination of gender\nis an integral part of personal autonomy and self-expression and\nfalls within the realm of personal liberty guaranteed under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India.148”\nDr Justice A K Sikri wrote a lucid concurring judgment.\n146\nIbid, at page 490 (para 72)\n147\nIbid, at page 490 (para 73)\n148\nIbid, at page 491 (para 75)\n84\nPART H\nNALSA indicates the rationale for grounding of a right to privacy in the protection of\ngender identity within\nArticle 15.\nThe intersection of\nArticle 15\nwith\nArticle 21\nlocates\na constitutional right to privacy as an expression of individual autonomy, dignity and\nidentity. NALSA indicates that the right to privacy does not necessarily have to fall\nwithin the ambit of any one provision in the chapter on fundamental rights. Intersecting\nrights recognise the right to privacy. Though primarily, it is in the guarantee of life and\npersonal liberty under\nArticle 21\nthat a constitutional right to privacy dwells, it is\nenriched by the values incorporated in other rights which are enumerated in Part III of\nthe Constitution.\n85        In\nABC v The State (NCT of Delhi\n)149, the Court dealt with the question\nwhether it is imperative for an unwed mother to specifically notify the putative father\nof the child of her petition for appointment as guardian of her child. It was stated by\nthe mother of the child that she does not want the future of her child to be marred by\nany controversy regarding his paternity, which would indubitably result should the\nfather refuse to acknowledge the child as his own. It was her contention that her own\nfundamental right to privacy will be violated if she is compelled to disclose the name\nand particulars of the father of her child. Looking into the interest of the child, the\nBench directed that “if a single parent/unwed mother applies for the issuance of a Birth\nCertificate for a child born from her womb, the Authorities concerned may only require\n149\n(2015) 10 SCC 1\n85\nPART H\nher to furnish an affidavit to this effect, and must thereupon issue the Birth Certificate,\nunless there is a Court direction to the contrary”150.\n86         While considering the constitutional validity of the\nConstitution (Ninety-Ninth\nAmendment) Act, 2014\nwhich enunciated an institutional process for the appointment\nof judges, the concurring judgment of Justice Madan B Lokur in Supreme Court\nAdvocates on\nRecord Association v Union of India151\ndealt with privacy issues\ninvolved if disclosures were made about a candidate under consideration for\nappointment as a Judge of the Supreme Court or High Court. Dealing with the right to\nknow of the general public on the one hand and the right to privacy on the other hand,\nJustice Lokur noted that the latter is an “implicit fundamental right that all people\nenjoy”. Justice Lokur observed thus:\n“The balance between transparency and confidentiality is very\ndelicate and if some sensitive information about a particular person\nis made public, it can have a far-reaching impact on his/her\nreputation and dignity. The 99th Constitution Amendment Act and\nthe NJAC Act have not taken note of the privacy concerns of an\nindividual. This is important because it was submitted by the\nlearned Attorney General that the proceedings of NJAC will be\ncompletely transparent and any one can have access to information\nthat is available with NJAC. This is a rather sweeping\ngeneralization which obviously does not take into account the\nprivacy of a person who has been recommended for\nappointment, particularly as a Judge of the High Court or in the\nfirst instance as a Judge of the Supreme Court. The right to\nknow is not a fundamental right but at best it is an implicit\nfundamental right and it is hedged in with the implicit\nfundamental right to privacy that all people enjoy. The balance\nbetween the two implied fundamental rights is difficult to maintain,\n150\nIbid, at page 18 (para 28)\n151\n(2016) 5 SCC 1\n86\nPART H\nbut the 99th Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act do not\neven attempt to consider, let alone achieve that balance.”152\n(emphasis supplied)\n87         A comprehensive analysis of precedent has been necessary because it\nindicates the manner in which the debate on the existence of a constitutional right to\nprivacy has progressed. The content of the constitutional right to privacy and its\nlimitations have proceeded on a case to case basis, each precedent seeking to build\nupon and follow the previous formulations. The doctrinal foundation essentially rests\nupon the trilogy of M P Sharma – Kharak Singh – Gobind upon which subsequent\ndecisions including those in Rajagopal, PUCL, Canara Bank, Selvi and NALSA have\ncontributed. Reconsideration of the doctrinal basis cannot be complete without\nevaluating what the trilogy of cases has decided.\n88         M P Sharma dealt with a challenge to a search on the ground that the statutory\nprovision which authorized it, violated the guarantee against self-incrimination in\nArticle 20(3).\nIn the absence of a specific provision like the Fourth Amendment to the\nUS Constitution in the Indian Constitution, the Court answered the challenge by its\nruling that an individual who is subject to a search during the course of which material\nis seized does not make a voluntary testimonial statement of the nature that would\nattract\nArticle 20(3).\nThe Court distinguished a compulsory search from a voluntary\nstatement of disclosure in pursuance of a notice issued by an authority to produce\n152\nIbid, at page 676 (para 953)\n87\nPART H\ndocuments. It was the former category that was held to be involved in a compulsive\nsearch, which the Court held would not attract the guarantee against self-\nincrimination. The judgment, however, proceeded further to hold that in the absence\nof the right to privacy having been enumerated in the Constitution, a provision like the\nFourth Amendment to the US Constitution could not be read into our own. The\nobservation in regard to the absence of the right to privacy in our Constitution was\nstrictly speaking, not necessary for the decision of the Court in M P Sharma and the\nobservation itself is no more than a passing observation. Moreover, the decision does\nnot adjudicate upon whether privacy could be a constitutionally protected right under\nany other provision such as\nArticle 21\nor under\nArticle 19.\n89     Kharak Singh does not contain a reference to M P Sharma. The decision of\nthe majority in Kharak Singh is essentially divided into two parts; the first dealing with\nthe validity of a regulation for nocturnal domiciliary visits (which was struck down) and\nthe second dealing with the rest of the regulation (which was upheld). The decision\non the first part, which dealt with Regulation 236(b) conveys an inescapable\nimpression that the regulation invaded the sanctity of the home and was a violation of\nordered liberty. Though the reasoning of the Court does not use the expression\n‘privacy’, it alludes to the decision of the US Supreme Court in Wolf v Colorado, which\ndeals with privacy. Besides, the portion extracted in the judgment has a reference to\nprivacy specifically at two places. While holding domiciliary visits at night to be invalid,\nthe Court drew sustenance from the right to life under\nArticle 21\nwhich means\n88\nPART H\nsomething more than a mere animal existence. The right under\nArticle 21\nincludes the\nenjoyment of those faculties which render the right meaningful. Hence, the first part\nof the decision in Kharak Singh represents an amalgam of life, personal liberty and\nprivacy. It protects interests which are grounded in privacy under the rubric of liberty.\nThe difficulty in construing the decision arises because in the second part of its\ndecision, the majority upheld the rest of the regulation and observed (while doing so)\nthat there is an absence of a protected right to privacy under the Constitution. These\nobservations in the second part are at variance with those dealing with the first. The\nview about the absence of a right to privacy is an isolated observation which cannot\ncoexist with the essential determination rendered on the first aspect of the regulation.\nSubsequent Benches of this Court in the last five decades and more, have attempted\nto make coherent doctrine out of the uneasy coexistence between the first and the\nsecond parts of the decision in Kharak Singh. Several of them rely on the protection\nof interests grounded in privacy in the first part, under the conceptual foundation of\nordered liberty.\n90     Gobind proceeded on the basis of an assumption and explains what according\nto the Court would be the content of the right to privacy if it is held to be a constitutional\nright. Gobind underlines that the right would be intrinsic to ordered liberty and would\ncover intimate matters such as family, marriage and procreation. Gobind, while\nrecognizing that the right would not be absolute and would be subject to the regulatory\npower of the State, conditioned the latter on the existence of a compelling state\n89\nPART H\ninterest. The decision also brings in the requirement of a narrow tailoring of the\nregulation to meet the needs of a compelling interest. The Bench which decided\nGobind adverted to the decision in Kharak Singh (though not M P Sharma). Be that\nas it may, Gobind has proceeded on the basis of an assumption that the right to\nprivacy is a constitutionally protected right in India. Subsequent decisions of this Court\nhave treated the formulation of a right to privacy as one that emerges out of Kharak\nSingh or Gobind (or both). Evidently, it is the first part of the decision in Kharak\nSingh which is construed as having recognized a constitutional entitlement to privacy\nwithout reconciling the second part which contains a specific observation on the\nabsence of a protected constitutional right to privacy in the Constitution. Succeeding\nBenches of smaller strength were not obviously in a position to determine the\ncorrectness of the M P Sharma and Kharak Singh formulations. They had to weave\na jurisprudence of privacy as new challenges emerged from a variety of sources: wire-\ntapping, narco-analysis, gender based identity, medical information, informational\nautonomy and other manifestations of privacy. As far as the decisions following upon\nGobind are concerned, it does emerge that the assumptions which find specific\nmention in several parts of the decision were perhaps not adequately placed in\nperspective. Gobind has been construed by subsequent Benches as affirming the\nright to privacy.\n91     The right to privacy has been traced in the decisions which have been rendered\nover more than four decades to the guarantee of life and personal liberty in\nArticle 21\n90\nPART H\nand the freedoms set out in\nArticle 19.\nIn addition, India’s commitment to a world order\nfounded on respect for human rights has been noticed along with the specific articles\nof the UDHR and the ICCPR which embody the right to privacy. 153 In the view of this\nCourt, international law has to be construed as a part of domestic law in the absence\nof legislation to the contrary and, perhaps more significantly, the meaning of\nconstitutional guarantees must be illuminated by the content of international\nconventions to which India is a party. Consequently, as new cases brought new issues\nand problems before the Court, the content of the right to privacy has found\nelaboration in these diverse contexts. These would include telephone tapping (PUCL),\nprior restraints on publication of material on a death row convict (Rajagopal),\ninspection and search of confidential documents involving the banker - customer\nrelationship (Canara Bank), disclosure of HIV status (\nMr X v Hospital Z\n), food\npreferences and animal slaughter (Hinsa Virodhak Sangh), medical termination of\npregnancy (Suchita Srivastava), scientific tests in criminal investigation (Selvi),\ndisclosure of bank accounts held overseas (Ram Jethmalani) and the right of\ntransgenders (NALSA). Early cases dealt with police regulations authorising\nintrusions on liberty, such as surveillance. As Indian society has evolved, the assertion\nof the right to privacy has been considered by this Court in varying contexts replicating\nthe choices and autonomy of the individual citizen.\n153\nSee Rishika Taneja and Sidhant Kumar, Privacy Law: Principles, Injunctions and Compensation, Eastern\nBook Company (2014), for a comprehensive account on the right to privacy and privacy laws in India.\n91\nPART I\n92        The deficiency, however, is in regard to a doctrinal formulation of the basis on\nwhich it can be determined as to whether the right to privacy is constitutionally\nprotected. M P Sharma need not have answered the question; Kharak Singh dealt\nwith it in a somewhat inconsistent formulation while Gobind rested on assumption. M\nP Sharma being a decision of eight judges, this Bench has been called upon to decide\non the objection of the Union of India to the existence of such a right in the first place.\nI         The Indian Constitution\nPreamble\n93        The Preamble to the Constitution postulates that the people of India have\nresolved to constitute India into a Republic which (among other things) is Sovereign\nand Democratic and to secure to all its citizens:\n“JUSTICE, social, economic and political;\nLIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\nEQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among\nthem all\nFRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of\nthe Nation;…”\n94        In Sajjan Singh v State of Rajasthan154, Justice Mudholkar alluded to the fact\nthat the Preamble to our Constitution is “not of the common run” as is the Preamble\nin a legislative enactment but was marked both by a “stamp of deep deliberation” and\n154\n(1965) 1 SCR 933\n92\nPART I\nprecision. This was suggestive, in the words of the Court, of the special significance\nattached to the Preamble by the framers of the Constitution.\n95        In Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala155 (“Kesavananda Bharati”),\nChief Justice Sikri noticed that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution.          The\nPreamble emphasises the need to secure to all citizens justice, liberty, equality and\nfraternity. Together they constitute the founding faith or the blueprint of values\nembodied with a sense of permanence in the constitutional document. The Preamble\nspeaks of securing liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. Fraternity\nis to be promoted to assure the dignity of the individual. The individual lies at the core\nof constitutional focus and the ideals of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity animate\nthe vision of securing a dignified existence to the individual. The Preamble envisions\na social ordering in which fundamental constitutional values are regarded as\nindispensable to the pursuit of happiness. Such fundamental values have also found\nreflection in the foundational document of totalitarian regimes in other parts of the\nworld. What distinguishes India is the adoption of a democratic way of life, founded\non the rule of law. Democracy accepts differences of perception, acknowledges\ndivergences in ways of life, and respects dissent.\n155\n(1973) 4 SCC 225\n93\nPART I\nJurisprudence on dignity\n96        Over the last four decades, our constitutional jurisprudence has recognised the\ninseparable relationship between protection of life and liberty with dignity. Dignity as\na constitutional value finds expression in the Preamble. The constitutional vision\nseeks the realisation of justice (social, economic and political); liberty (of thought,\nexpression, belief, faith and worship); equality (as a guarantee against arbitrary\ntreatment of individuals) and fraternity (which assures a life of dignity to every\nindividual). These constitutional precepts exist in unity to facilitate a humane and\ncompassionate society. The individual is the focal point of the Constitution because it\nis in the realisation of individual rights that the collective well being of the community\nis determined. Human dignity is an integral part of the Constitution. Reflections of\ndignity are found in the guarantee against arbitrariness (\nArticle 14\n), the lamps of\nfreedom (\nArticle 19\n) and in the right to life and personal liberty (\nArticle 21\n).\n97        In\nPrem Shankar Shukla v Delhi Administration156\n, which arose from the\nhandcuffing of the prisoners, Justice Krishna Iyer, speaking for a three-judge Bench\nof this Court held:\n“…the guarantee of human dignity, which forms part of our\nconstitutional culture, and the positive provisions of\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\n21\nspring into action when we realise that to manacle man is\nmore than to mortify him; it is to dehumanize him and, therefore, to\n156\n(1980) 3 SCC 526\n94\nPART I\nviolate his very personhood, too often using the mask of\n'dangerousness' and security…157\nThe Preamble sets the humane tone and temper of the Founding\nDocument and highlights Justice, Equality and the dignity of the\nindividual. 158”\n98      A Bench of two judges in\nFrancis Coralie Mullin v Union Territory of Delhi159\n(“Francis Coralie”\n) while construing the entitlement of a detenue under the\nConservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities\n(COFEPOSA) Act, 1974\nto have an interview with a lawyer and the members of his\nfamily held that:\n“The fundamental right to life which is the most precious human\nright and which forms the ark of all other rights must therefore be\ninterpreted in a broad and expansive spirit so as to invest it with\nsignificance and vitality which may endure for years to come and\nenhance the dignity of the individual and the worth of the human\nperson…160\n…the right to life enshrined in\nArticle 21\ncannot be restricted to mere\nanimal existence. It means something much more than just physical\nsurvival.161\n…We think that the right to life includes the right to live with human\ndignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries\nof life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities\nfor reading, writing and expressing one-self in diverse forms, freely\nmoving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human\nbeings…Every act which offends against or impairs human dignity\nwould constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right to live and it would\nhave to be in accordance with reasonable, fair and just procedure\n157\nIbid, at pages 529-530 (para 1)\n158\nIbid, at page 537 (para 21)\n159\n(1981) 1 SCC 608\n160\nIbid, at page 618 (para 6)\n161\nIbid, at page 618 (para 7)\n95\nPART I\nestablished by law which stands the test of other fundamental\nrights…162”\n99      In\nBandhua Mukti Morcha v Union of India163\n, a Bench of three judges of this\nCourt while dealing with individuals who were living in bondage observed that:\n“…This right to live with human dignity enshrined in\nArticle\n21\nderives its life breath from the Directive Principles of\nState Policy and particularly Clause (e) and (f) of “Article 39\nand Arts. 41 and 42 and at the least, therefore, it must\ninclude protection of the health and strength of the workers,\nmen and women, and of the tender age of children against\nabuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in\na healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity,\neducational facilities, just and humane conditions of work\nand maternity relief. These are the minimum requirements\nwhich must exist in order to enable a person to live with\nhuman dignity, and nor State - neither the Central\nGovernment - has the right to take any action which will\ndeprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic\nessentials.”164\n100     Dealing with an allegation that activists of an organization were arrested and\nparaded throughout the town by the police and were beaten up in police custody, this\nCourt in Khedat Mazdoor Chetna Sangath v State of M P165 held that:\n“It is, therefore, absolutely essential in the interest of justice,\nhuman dignity and democracy that this Court must\nintervene; order an investigation determine the correct facts\nand take strongest possible action against the respondents\nwho are responsible for these atrocities…166\n162\nIbid, at pages 618-619 (para 8)\n163\n(1984) 3 SCC 161\n164\nIbid, at page 183 (para 10)\n165\n(1994) 6 SCC 260\n166\nIbid, at pages 262-263 (para 10)\n96\nPART I\nIf dignity or honor vanishes what remains of life. 167”\n101     Human dignity was construed in\nM Nagaraj v Union of India168\nby a\nConstitution Bench of this Court to be intrinsic to and inseparable from human\nexistence. Dignity, the Court held, is not something which is conferred and which can\nbe taken away, because it is inalienable:\n“The rights, liberties and freedoms of the individual are not\nonly to be protected against the State, they should be\nfacilitated by it… It is the duty of the State not only to\nprotect the human dignity but to facilitate it by taking\npositive steps in that direction. No exact definition of\nhuman dignity exists. It refers to the intrinsic value of\nevery human being, which is to be respected. It cannot\nbe taken away. It cannot give. It simply is. Every human\nbeing has dignity by virtue of his existence…169\nIndia is constituted into a sovereign, democratic republic to\nsecure to all its citizens, fraternity assuring the dignity of the\nindividual and the unity of the nation. The sovereign,\ndemocratic republic exists to promote fraternity and the\ndignity of the individual citizen and to secure to the citizens\ncertain rights. This is because the objectives of the State\ncan be realized only in and through the individuals.\nTherefore, rights conferred on citizens and non-citizens are\nnot merely individual or personal rights. They have a large\nsocial and political content, because the objectives of the\nConstitution cannot be otherwise realized.170” (emphasis\nsupplied)\n167\nIbid, at pages 271 (para 37)\n168\n(2006) 8 SCC 212\n169\nIbid, at page 243-244 (para 26)\n170\nIbid, at pages 247-248 (para 42)\n97\nPART I\n102     In\nMaharashtra University of Health Sciences v Satchikitsa Prasarak\nMandal171\n, this Court held that the dignity of the individual is a core constitutional\nconcept. In Selvi, this Court recognised that:\n“…we must recognize that a forcible intrusion into a person's\nmental processes is also an affront to human dignity and\nliberty,  often     with    grave       and      long-lasting\nconsequences…”  172\n103     In\nDr Mehmood Nayyar Azam v State of Chhattisgarh173\n, this Court noted\nthat when dignity is lost, life goes into oblivion. The same emphasis on dignity finds\nexpression in the decision in NALSA.\n104     The same principle was more recently reiterated in\nShabnam v Union of\nIndia174\nin the following terms:\n“This right to human dignity has many elements. First and foremost,\nhuman dignity is the dignity of each human being ‘as a human\nbeing’. Another element, which needs to be highlighted, in the\ncontext of the present case, is that human dignity is infringed if a\nperson’s life, physical or mental welfare is alarmed. It is in this\nsense torture, humiliation, forced labour, etc. all infringe on human\ndignity. It is in this context many rights of the accused derive from\nhis dignity as a human being.”175\n171\n(2010) 3 SCC 786\n172\nIbid, at page 376 (para 244)\n173\n(2012) 8 SCC 1\n174\n(2015) 6 SCC 702\n175\nIbid, at page 713 (para 14)\n98\nPART I\n105     The recent decision in\nJeeja Ghosh v Union of India176\nconstrued the\nconstitutional protection afforded to human dignity. The Court observed:\n“…human dignity is a constitutional value and a constitutional goal.\nWhat are the dimensions of constitutional value of human dignity?\nIt is beautifully illustrated by Aharon Barak177 (former Chief Justice\nof the Supreme Court of Israel) in the following manner:\n“The constitutional value of human dignity has a\ncentral normative role. Human dignity as a\nconstitutional value is the factor that unites the human\nrights into one whole. It ensures the normative unity of\nhuman rights. This normative unity is expressed in the\nthree ways: first, the value of human dignity serves as\na normative basis for constitutional rights set out in the\nconstitution; second, it serves as an interpretative\nprinciple for determining the scope of constitutional\nrights, including the right to human dignity; third, the\nvalue of human dignity has an important role in\ndetermining the proportionality of a statute limiting a\nconstitutional right.”178\n106     Life is precious in itself. But life is worth living because of the freedoms which\nenable each individual to live life as it should be lived. The best decisions on how life\nshould be lived are entrusted to the individual. They are continuously shaped by the\nsocial milieu in which individuals exist. The duty of the state is to safeguard the ability\nto take decisions – the autonomy of the individual – and not to dictate those decisions.\n‘Life’ within the meaning of\nArticle 21\nis not confined to the integrity of the physical\n176\n(2016) 7 SCC 761\n177\nAharon Barak, Human Dignity- The Constitutional Value and the Constitutional Right, Cambridge University\nPress (2015)\n178\nSupra Note 176, at page 792 (para 37)\n99\nPART I\nbody. The right comprehends one’s being in its fullest sense. That which facilitates\nthe fulfilment of life is as much within the protection of the guarantee of life.\n107       To live is to live with dignity. The draftsmen of the Constitution defined their\nvision of the society in which constitutional values would be attained by emphasising,\namong other freedoms, liberty and dignity. So fundamental is dignity that it permeates\nthe core of the rights guaranteed to the individual by Part III. Dignity is the core which\nunites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each\nindividual the dignity of existence. Privacy with its attendant values assures dignity to\nthe individual and it is only when life can be enjoyed with dignity can liberty be of true\nsubstance. Privacy ensures the fulfilment of dignity and is a core value which the\nprotection of life and liberty is intended to achieve.\nFundamental Rights cases\n108       In\nGolak Nath v State of Punjab179\n, there was a challenge to the\nPunjab\nSecurity of Land Tenures Act, 1953\nand to the Mysore Land Reforms Act (as\namended) upon their inclusion in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution.\nChief Justice Subba Rao dwelt on the rule of law and its purpose in ensuring that\nevery authority constituted by the Constitution is subject to it and functions within its\n179\n(1967) 2 SCR 762\n100\nPART I\nparameters. One of the purposes of constraining governmental power was to shield\nthe fundamental freedoms against legislative majorities. This thought is reflected in\nthe following extract from the judgment of Chief Justice Subba Rao:\n“…But, having regard to the past history of our country, it could not\nimplicitly believe the representatives of the people, for uncontrolled\nand unrestricted power might lead to an authoritarian State. It,\ntherefore, preserves the natural rights against the State\nencroachment and constitutes the higher judiciary of the State\nas the sentinel of the said rights and the balancing wheel\nbetween the rights, subject to social control. In short, the\nfundamental rights, subject to social control, have been\nincorporated in the rule of law…”180     (emphasis supplied)\nThe learned Judge emphasised the position of the fundamental rights thus:\n“…They are the rights of the people preserved by our Constitution.\n“Fundamental Rights” are the modern name for what have\nbeen traditionally known as “natural rights”. As one author\nputs: “they are moral rights which every human being everywhere\nall times ought to have simply because of the fact that in\ncontradistinction with other things is rational and moral”. They are\nthe primordial rights necessary for the development of human\npersonality. They are the rights which enable a man to chalk out of\nhis own life in the manner he likes best…”181 (emphasis supplied)\nThe fundamental rights, in other words, are primordial rights which have traditionally\nbeen regarded as natural rights. In that character these rights are inseparable from\nhuman existence.             They have been preserved by the Constitution, this being a\nrecognition of their existence even prior to the constitutional document.\n180\nIbid, at page 788\n181\nIbid, at page 789\n101\nPART I\n109   In Kesavananda Bharati, a Bench of 13 judges considered the nature of the\namending power conferred by\nArticle 368\nand whether the exercise of the amending\npower was subject to limitations in its curtailment of the fundamental freedoms. Chief\nJustice Sikri held that the fundamental rights are inalienable. In his view, the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights had to be utilised to interpret the Constitution having\nregard to the mandate of\nArticle 51.\nIndia, having acceded to the Universal\nDeclaration, Sikri, C.J. held that the treatment of rights as inalienable must guide the\ninterpretation of the Court. The Chief Justice relied upon a line of precedent holding\nthese rights to be natural and inalienable and observed:\n“300. Various decisions of this Court describe fundamental rights\nas ‘natural rights’ or ‘human rights’. Some of these decisions are\nextracted below:\n“There can be no doubt that the people of India have in exercise of\ntheir sovereign will as expressed in the Preamble, adopted the\ndemocratic ideal, which assures to the citizen the dignity of the\nindividual and other cherished human values as a means to the full\nevolution and expression of his personality, and in delegating to the\nlegislature, the executive and the judiciary their respective powers\nin the Constitution, reserved to themselves certain fundamental\nrights so-called, I apprehend because they have been retained by\nthe people and made paramount to the delegated powers, as in the\nAmerican Model. (Per Patanjali Sastri, J., in\nGopalan v. State of\nMadras\n. [AIR 1950 SC 27: 1950 SCR 88, 198-199 : 1950 SCJ 174]\n(Emphasis supplied).\n(ii) “That article (\nArticle 19\n) enumerates certain freedoms under the\ncaption ‘right to freedom’ and deals with those great and basic\nrights which are recognised and guaranteed as the natural\nrights inherent in the status of a citizen of a free country. (Per\nPatanjali Sastri, C J., in\nState of West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal\nBose\n[AIR 1954 SC 92 : 1954 SCR 587, 596 : 1954 SCJ 127] )\n(Emphasis supplied).\n102\nPART I\n“I have no doubt that the framers of our Constitution drew the same\ndistinction and classed the natural right or capacity of a citizen ‘to\nacquire, hold and dispose of property’ with other natural rights and\nfreedoms inherent in the status of a free citizen and embodied them\nin\nArticle 19(1)\n… (ibid, p. 597)” (Emphasis supplied).\n“For all these reasons, I am of opinion that under the scheme of the\nConstitution, all those broad and basic freedoms inherent in the\nstatus of a citizen as a free man are embodied and protected from\ninvasion by the State under clause (1) of Article 19…” (ibid, p. 600)\n(Emphasis supplied).\n(iii) “The people, however, regard certain rights as paramount,\nbecause they embrace liberty of action to the individual in\nmatters of private life, social intercourse and share in the\nGovernment of the country and other spheres. The people who\nvested the three limbs of Government with their power and\nauthority, at the same time kept back these rights of citizens and\nalso some times of non-citizens, and made them inviolable except\nunder certain conditions. The rights thus kept back are placed in\nPart III of the Constitution, which is headed ‘Fundamental Rights’,\nand the conditions under which these rights can be abridged are\nalso indicated in that Part. (Per Hidayatullah,J. in Ujjambai v. State\nof U.P. [(1963) 1 SCR 778, 926-27 : AIR 1962 SC 1621]) (Emphasis\nsupplied).\n301. The High Court Allahabad has described them as follows:\n“(iv)…man has certain natural or inalienable rights and that it\nis the function of the State, in order that human liberty might\nbe preserved and human personality developed, to give\nrecognition and free play to those rights…suffice it to say that\nthey represent a trend in the democratic thought of our age. (\nMotilal\nv. State of U.P.\n)” (Emphasis supplied).”182\nThis was the doctrinal basis for holding that the fundamental rights could not be\n“amended out of existence”. Elaborating all those features of the Constitution which\nformed a part of the basic structure, Sikri, C J held that:\n182\nSupra note 155, at page 367-368 (para 300)\n103\nPART I\n“The learned Attorney-General said that every provision of the\nConstitution is essential; otherwise it would not have been put in the\nConstitution. This is true. But this does not place every provision of\nthe Constitution in the same position. The true position is that every\nprovision of the Constitution can be amended provided in the result\nthe basic foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the\nsame. The basic structure may be said to consist of the following\nfeatures:\n(1) Supremacy of the Constitution;\n(2) Republican and Democratic form of Government;\n(3) Secular character of the Constitution;\n(4) Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and\nthe judiciary;\n(5) Federal character of the Constitution.”183\nJustices Shelat and Grover held that “[t]he dignity of the individual secured by the\nvarious freedoms and basic rights in Part III and the mandate to build a welfare State\ncontained in Part IV”184 constituted a part of the basic structure.\nJustices Hegde and Mukherjea emphasised that the primary object before the\nConstituent Assembly were: (i) to constitute India into a sovereign, democratic\nrepublic and (ii) to secure its citizens the rights mentioned in it. Hence, the learned\nJudges found it impossible to accept that the Constitution makers would have made\na provision in the Constitution itself for the destruction of the very ideals which they\nhad embodied in the fundamental rights. Hence, Parliament had no power to abrogate\nthe fundamental features of the Constitution including among them “the essential\nfeatures of the individual freedoms secured to the citizens”.\n“On a careful consideration of the various aspects of the case, we\nare convinced that the Parliament has no power to abrogate or\n183\nIbid, at page 366 (para 292)\n184\nIbid, at page 454 (para 582)\n104\nPART I\nemasculate the basic elements or fundamental features of the\nConstitution such as the sovereignty of India, the democratic\ncharacter of our polity, the unity of the country, the essential\nfeatures of the individual freedoms secured to the citizens. Nor\nhas the Parliament the power to revoke the mandate to build a\nwelfare State and egalitarian society. These limitations are only\nillustrative and not exhaustive. Despite these limitations, however,\nthere can be no question that the amending power is a wide power\nand it reaches every Article and every part of the Constitution. That\npower can be used to reshape the Constitution to fulfil the obligation\nimposed on the State. It can also be used to reshape the\nConstitution within the limits mentioned earlier, to make it an\neffective instrument for social good. We are unable to agree with\nthe contention that in order to build a welfare State, it is\nnecessary to destroy some of the human freedoms. That, at\nany rate is not the perspective of our Constitution. Our\nConstitution envisages that the State should without delay\nmake available to all the citizens of this country the real\nbenefits of those freedoms in a democratic way. Human\nfreedoms are lost gradually and imperceptibly and their destruction\nis generally followed by authoritarian rule. That is what history has\ntaught us. Struggle between liberty and power is eternal. Vigilance\nis the price that we like every other democratic society have to pay\nto safeguard the democratic values enshrined in our Constitution.\nEven the best of Governments are not averse to have more and\nmore power to carry out their plans and programmes which they\nmay sincerely believe to be in public interest. But a freedom once\nlost is hardly ever regained except by revolution. Every\nencroachment on freedom sets a pattern for further encroachments.\nOur constitutional plan is to eradicate poverty without\ndestruction of individual freedoms.”185 (emphasis supplied)\nJustice Jaganmohan Reddy held that:\n“…Parliament cannot under\nArticle 368\nexpand its power of\namendment so as to confer on itself the power to repeal, abrogate\nthe Constitution or damage, emasculate or destroy any of the\nfundamental rights or essential elements of the basic structure of\nthe Constitution or of destroying the identity of the Constitution…”186\n185\nIbid, at pages 486-487 (para 666)\n186\nIbid, at page 666 (para 1212)\n105\nPART I\nJustice Khanna in the course of the summation of his conclusions held, as regards\nthe power of amendment, that:\n“The power of amendment under\nArticle 368\ndoes not include the\npower to abrogate the Constitution nor does it include the power to\nalter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. Subject to\nthe retention of the basic structure or framework of the Constitution,\nthe power of amendment is plenary and includes within itself the\npower to amend the various articles of the Constitution, including\nthose relating to fundamental rights as well as those which may be\nsaid to relate to essential features. No part of a fundamental right\ncan claim immunity from amendatory process by being described\nas the essence, or core of that right. The power of amendment\nwould also include within itself the power to add, alter or repeal the\nvarious articles.”187\nSignificantly, even though Justice Mathew was in the minority, the learned Judge in\nthe course of his decision observed the importance of human dignity:\n“The social nature of man, the generic traits of his physical and\nmental constitution, his sentiments of justice and the morals within,\nhis instinct for individual and collective preservations, his desire for\nhappiness, his sense of human dignity, his consciousness of man’s\nstation and purpose in life, all these are not products of fancy but\nobjective factors in the realm of existence…”188\n110     In\nIndira Nehru Gandhi v Raj Narain189, Justice Khanna\nclarified that his view\nin Kesavananda Bharati is that Parliament in the exercise of its power to amend the\nConstitution cannot destroy or abrogate the basic structure of the Constitution. No\ndistinction was made in regard to the scope of the amending power relating to the\n187\nIbid, at page 824 (para 1537(vii))\n188\nIbid, at pages 866-867 (para 1676)\n189\n(1975) 1 Suppl. SCC 1\n106\nPART I\nprovisions of the fundamental rights and in respect of matters other than the\nfundamental rights:\n“…The limitation inherent in the word “amendment” according to\nwhich it is not permissible by amendment of the Constitution to\nchange the basic structure of the Constitution was to operate\nequally on articles pertaining to fundamental rights as on other\narticles not pertaining to those rights…”190\nJustice Khanna noted that the right to property was held by him not to be a part of the\nbasic structure. Justice Khanna observed that it would have been unnecessary for\nhim to hold so, if none of the fundamental rights were to be a part of the basic structure\nof the Constitution.\n111        Chandrachud C J, in the course of his judgment for the Constitution Bench in\nMinerva Mills Ltd v Union of India191\n, traced the history of the evolution of inalienable\nrights, founded in inviolable liberties, during the course of the freedom movement and\nobserved that both Parts III and IV of the Constitution had emerged as inseparably\ninter-twined, without a distinction between the negative and positive obligations of the\nstate.\nThe Constitution, in this view, is founded on “the bedrock of the balance between\nParts III and IV” and to give absolute primacy to one over the other would be to disturb\nthe harmony of the Constitution. In the view of the Chief Justice:\n190\nIbid, at page 115 (para 251)\n191\n(1980) 3 SCC 625\n107\nPART I\n“The edifice of our Constitution is built upon the concepts\ncrystallised in the Preamble. We resolved to constitute ourselves\ninto a Socialist State which carried with it the obligation to secure to\nour people justice – social, economic and political. We, therefore,\nput Part IV into our Constitution containing directive principles of\nState policy which specify the socialistic goal to be achieved. We\npromised to our people a democratic polity which carries with it the\nobligation of securing to the people liberty of thought, expression,\nbelief, faith and worship; equality of status and of opportunity and\nthe assurance that the dignity of the individual will at all costs be\npreserved. We, therefore, put Part III in our Constitution conferring\nthose rights on the people…”192\nArticles 14\nand\n19\n, the Court held, confer rights essential for the proper functioning of\na democracy and are universally so regarded by the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. Withdrawing the protection of\nArticles 14\nand\n19\nwas plainly impermissible\nand the immunity granted by the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution to a law against\nthe challenge that it violates\nArticles 14\nor 19 (if the law is for giving effect to the\nDirective Principles) amounted to a violation of the basic structure.\nNo waiver of Fundamental Rights\n112        In Behram Khurshed Pesikaka v The State of Bombay193, Chief Justice\nMahajan, speaking for the Constitution Bench, noted the link between the\nconstitutional vision contained in the Preamble and the position of the fundamental\nrights as a means to facilitate its fulfilment. Though Part III embodies fundamental\nrights, this was construed to be part of the wider notion of securing the vision of justice\n192\nIbid, at page 654 (para 57)\n193\n(1955) 1 SCR 613\n108\nPART I\nof the founding fathers and, as a matter of doctrine, the rights guaranteed were held\nnot to be capable of being waived. Mahajan, CJ, observed:\n“We think that the rights described as fundamental rights are a\nnecessary consequence of the declaration in the Preamble that the\npeople of India have solemnly resolved to constitute India into a\nsovereign democratic republic and to secure to all its citizens\njustice, social, economic and political; liberty of thought, expression,\nbelief, faith and worship; equality of status and of opportunity.\nThese fundamental rights have not been put in the Constitution\nmerely for individual benefit, though ultimately they come into\noperation in considering individual rights. They have been put there\nas a matter of public policy and the doctrine of waiver can have no\napplication to provisions of law which have been enacted as a\nmatter of constitutional policy.”194\nPrivacy as intrinsic to freedom and liberty\n113        The submission that recognising the right to privacy is an exercise which would\nrequire a constitutional amendment and cannot be a matter of judicial interpretation is\nnot an acceptable doctrinal position. The argument assumes that the right to privacy\nis independent of the liberties guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. There lies\nthe error. The right to privacy is an element of human dignity. The sanctity of privacy\nlies in its functional relationship with dignity. Privacy ensures that a human being can\nlead a life of dignity by securing the inner recesses of the human personality from\nunwanted intrusion. Privacy recognises the autonomy of the individual and the right\nof every person to make essential choices which affect the course of life. In doing so\nprivacy recognises that living a life of dignity is essential for a human being to fulfil the\n194\nIbid, at pages 653-654\n109\nPART I\nliberties and freedoms which are the cornerstone of the Constitution. To recognise the\nvalue of privacy as a constitutional entitlement and interest is not to fashion a new\nfundamental right by a process of amendment through judicial fiat.\nNeither are the\njudges nor is the process of judicial review entrusted with the constitutional\nresponsibility to amend the Constitution. But judicial review certainly has the task\nbefore it of determining the nature and extent of the freedoms available to each person\nunder the fabric of those constitutional guarantees which are protected. Courts have\ntraditionally discharged that function and in the context of\nArticle 21\nitself, as we have\nalready noted, a panoply of protections governing different facets of a dignified\nexistence has been held to fall within the protection of\nArticle 21.\n114       In\nOlga Tellis v Bombay Municipal Corporation195, Chandrachud C J\n, while\nexplaining the ambit of\nArticle 21\nfound a rationale for protecting the right to livelihood\nas an incident of the right to life. For, as the Court held, deprivation of livelihood would\nresult in the abrogation of the right to life:\n“148. The sweep of the right to life conferred by\nArticle 21\nis wide\nand far-reaching. It does not mean merely that life cannot be\nextinguished or taken away as, for example, by the imposition and\nexecution of the death sentence, except according to procedure\nestablished by law. That is but one aspect of the right to life. An\nequally important facet of that right is the right to livelihood because,\nno person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of\nlivelihood. If the right to livelihood is not treated as a part of the\nconstitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of\nhis right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to\nthe point of abrogation. Such deprivation would not only denude the\n195\n(1985) 3 SCC 545\n110\nPART I\nlife of its effective content and meaningfulness but it would make\nlife impossible to live. And yet, such deprivation would not have to\nbe in accordance with the procedure established by law, if the right\nto livelihood is not regarded as a part of the right to life. That, which\nalone makes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life liveable,\nmust be deemed to be an integral component of the right to life.\nDeprive a person of his right to livelihood and you shall have\ndeprived him of his life…”196\n115     In Unnikrishnan v State of Andhra Pradesh197, Justice Jeevan Reddy,\nspeaking for this Court, held that though the right to education (as the Constitution\nthen stood) was not “stated expressly as a fundamental right” in Part III, that would\nnot militate against its being protected under the rubric of life under\nArticle 21.\nThese\ndecisions have been ultimately guided by the object of a Constitutional Court which\nmust be to expand the boundaries of fundamental human freedoms rather than to\nattenuate their content through a constricted judicial interpretation In Maneka, it has\nbeen stated that:\n“The attempt of the court should be to expand the reach and ambit\nof the fundamental rights rather than attenuate their meaning and\ncontent by process of judicial construction…\n“personal liberty” in\nArticle 21\nis of the widest amplitude.”198\n116     Now, would this Court in interpreting the Constitution freeze the content of\nconstitutional guarantees and provisions to what the founding fathers perceived? The\nConstitution was drafted and adopted in a historical context.                      The vision of the\nfounding fathers was enriched by the histories of suffering of those who suffered\n196\nIbid, at page 572 (para 32)\n197\n(1993) 1 SCC 645\n198\nManeka (Supra note 5), at page 280 (para 5)\n111\nPART I\noppression and a violation of dignity both here and elsewhere. Yet, it would be difficult\nto dispute that many of the problems which contemporary societies face would not\nhave been present to the minds of the most perspicacious draftsmen. No generation,\nincluding the present, can have a monopoly over solutions or the confidence in its\nability to foresee the future. As society evolves, so must constitutional doctrine. The\ninstitutions which the Constitution has created must adapt flexibly to meet the\nchallenges in a rapidly growing knowledge economy.              Above all, constitutional\ninterpretation is but a process in achieving justice, liberty and dignity to every citizen.\n117       Undoubtedly, there have been aberrations. In the evolution of the doctrine in\nIndia, which places the dignity of the individual and freedoms and liberties at the\nforefront, there have been a few discordant notes. Two of them need attention.\nDiscordant Notes\n(i)       ADM Jabalpur\n118       In ADM Jabalpur v Shivakant Shukla199 (“ADM Jabalpur”), the issue before\nthis Court was whether an order issued by the President under\nArticle 359(1)\nof the\nConstitution suspends the right of every person to move any Court for the enforcement\nof the right to personal liberty under\nArticle 21\nupon being detained under a law\nproviding for preventive detention. The submission of the detenues in this Court was\n199\n(1976) 2 SCC 521\n112\nPART I\nthat the suspension of the remedy to enforce\nArticle 21\ndoes not automatically entail\nsuspension of the right or the rule of law and that even during an emergency the rule\nof law could not be suspended. A majority of four judges of this Court (Justice H R\nKhanna dissenting) held that:\n“Liberty is confined and controlled by law, whether common law or\nstatute. It is in the words of Burke a regulated freedom. It is not an\nabstract or absolute freedom. The safeguard of liberty is in the good\nsense of the people and in the system of representative and\nresponsible government which has been evolved. If extraordinary\npowers are given, they are given because the emergency is\nextraordinary, and are limited to the period of the emergency.”200\nDealing with the issue as to whether\nArticle 21\nis the sole repository of the right to life,\nRay C J, observed that where any right which existed before the commencement of\nthe Constitution has been incorporated in Part III, the common law right would not\nexist under the Constitution. In a concurring judgment Justice Beg held that while\nadopting the Constitution, there was a notional surrender by the people of India of the\ncontrol over these rights to a sovereign republic and it is only the Constitution which\nis supreme and which can confer rights and powers. There was, in this view, a notional\nsurrender of individual freedom. Justice Beg held that:\n“The whole object of guaranteed fundamental rights is to make\nthose basic aspects of human freedom, embodied in fundamental\nrights, more secure than others not so selected. In thus recognising\nand declaring certain basic aspects of rights as fundamental by the\nConstitution of the country, the purpose was to protect them against\nundue encroachments upon them by the legislative, or executive,\nand, sometimes even judicial (e.g.\nArticle 20\n) organs of the State.\nThe encroachment must remain within permissible limits and must\n200\nIbid, at page 571 (para 33)\n113\nPART I\ntake place only in prescribed modes. The intention could never\nbe to preserve something concurrently in the field of natural\nlaw or common law. It was to exclude all other control or to\nmake the Constitution the sole repository of ultimate control\nover those aspects of human freedom which were guaranteed\nthere.”201 (emphasis supplied)\nA similar position was adopted by Justice Chandrachud:\n“The right to personal liberty has no hallmark and therefore\nwhen the right is put in action it is impossible to identify\nwhether the right is one given by the Constitution or is one\nwhich existed in the pre-Constitution era. If the argument of the\nrespondents is correct, no action to enforce the right to personal\nliberty can at all fall within the mischief of the Presidential Order\neven if it mentions\nArticles 19\n, 20\n, 21\nand\n22\nbecause, every\npreliminary objection by the Government to a petition to enforce the\nright to personal liberty can be effectively answered by contending\nthat what is being enforced is either the natural right to personal\nliberty or generally, the pre-Constitution right to personal liberty.\nThe error of the respondents argument lies in its assumption,\nand in regard to the argument of some of the counsel in its\nmajor articulate premise, that the qualitative content of the\nnon-constitutional or pre-constitutional right to personal\nliberty is different from the content of the right to personal\nliberty conferred by Part III of the Constitution…”202\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn his view:\n“It therefore does not make any difference whether any right to\npersonal liberty was in existence prior to the enactment of the\nConstitution, either by way of a natural right, statutory right,\ncommon law right or a right available under the law of torts.\nWhatever may be the source of the right and whatever may be its\njurisdiction, the right in essence and substance is the right to\npersonal liberty. That right having been included in Part III, its\n201\nIbid, at page 604 (para 183)\n202\nIbid, at page 664 (para 379)\n114\nPART I\nenforcement will stand suspended if it is mentioned in the\nPresidential Order issued under\nArticle 359(1)\n.”203\nJustice Bhagwati held as follows:\n“Now, to my mind, it is clear that when this principle of rule of law\nthat the Executive cannot deprive a person of his liberty except by\nauthority of law, is recognised and embodied as a fundamental right\nand enacted as such in\nArticle 21\n, it is difficult to comprehend how\nit could continue to have a distinct and separate existence,\nindependently and apart from this article in which it has been given\nconstitutional vesture. I fail to see how it could continue in force\nunder\nArticle 372\nwhen it is expressly recognised and embodied as\na fundamental right in\nArticle 21\nand finds a place in the express\nprovisions of the Constitution. Once this principle is recognised\nand incorporated in the Constitution and forms part of it, it\ncould not have any separate existence apart from the\nConstitution, unless it were also enacted as a statutory\nprinciple by some positive law of the State…”204 (emphasis\nsupplied)\nIn his view, it is the Constitution which is supreme and if it ordains that a person who\nis detained otherwise than in accordance with law would not be entitled to enforce the\nright of personal liberty, the Court was duty bound to give effect to it:\n“…it cannot be overlooked that, in the ultimate analysis, the\nprotection of personal liberty and the supremacy of law which\nsustains it must be governed by the Constitution itself. The\nConstitution is the paramount and supreme law of the land and if it\nsays that even if a person is detained otherwise than in accordance\nwith the law. he shall not be entitled to enforce his right of personal\nliberty, whilst a Presidential Order under\nArticle 359\n, clause (1)\nspecifying\nArticle 21\nis in force, I have to give effect to it. Sitting as\nI do, as a Judge under the Constitution, I cannot ignore the plain\nand emphatic command of the Constitution for what I may consider\nto be necessary to meet the ends of justice. It is said that law has\n203\nIbid, at page 666 (para 383)\n204\nIbid, at page 701 (para 459)\n115\nPART I\nthe feminine capacity to tempt each devotee to find his own image\nin her bosom. No one escapes entirely. Some yield blindly, some\nwith sophistication. Only a few more or less effectively resist. I have\nalways leaned in favour of upholding personal liberty, for, I believe,\nit is one of the most cherished values of mankind. Without it life\nwould not be worth living. It is one of the pillars of free democratic\nsociety. Men have readily laid down their lives at its altar, in order\nto secure it, protect it and preserve it. But I do not think it would be\nright for me to allow my love of personal liberty to cloud my vision\nor to persuade me to place on the relevant provision of the\nConstitution a construction which its language cannot reasonably\nbear. I cannot assume to myself the role of Plato's “Philosopher\nKing” in order to render what I consider ideal justice between the\ncitizen and the State. After all, the Constitution is the law of all laws\nand there alone judicial conscience must find its ultimate support\nand its final resting place. It is in this spirit of humility and obedience\nto the Constitution and driven by judicial compulsion, that I have\ncome to the conclusion that the Presidential Order dated June 27,\n1975 bars maintainability of a writ petition for habeas corpus where\nan order of detention is challenged on the ground that it is mala fide\nor not under the Act or not in compliance with it.”205\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Khanna emphatically held that the suspension of the\nright to move any Court for the enforcement of the right under\nArticle 21\n, upon a\nproclamation of emergency, would not affect the enforcement of the basic right to life\nand liberty. The Constitution was not the sole repository of the right to life and liberty:\n“I am of the opinion that\nArticle 21\ncannot be considered to be the\nsole repository of the right to life and personal liberty. The right to\nlife and personal liberty is the most precious right of human beings\nin civilised societies governed by the rule of law. Many modern\nConstitutions incorporate certain fundamental rights, including the\none relating to personal freedom. According to Blackstone, the\nabsolute rights of Englishmen were the rights of personal security,\npersonal liberty and private property. The American Declaration of\nIndependence (1776) states that all men are created equal, and\n205\nIbid, at pages 723-724 (para 487)\n116\nPART I\namong their inalienable rights are life, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness…”206\nEven in the absence of\nArticle 21\n, it would not have been permissible for the State to\ndeprive a person of his life and liberty without the authority of the law:\n“Even in the absence of\nArticle 21\nin the Constitution, the State has\ngot no power to deprive a person of his life or liberty without the\nauthority of law. This is the essential postulate and basic\nassumption of the rule of law and not of men in all civilised nations.\nWithout such sanctity of life and liberty, the distinction between a\nlawless society and one governed by laws would cease to have any\nmeaning. The principle that no one shall be deprived of his life or\nliberty without the authority of law is rooted in the consideration that\nlife and liberty are priceless possessions which cannot be made the\nplaything of individual whim and caprice and that any act which has\nthe effect of tampering with life and liberty must receive sustenance\nfrom and sanction of the laws of the land.\nArticle 21\nincorporates an\nessential aspect of that principle and makes it part of the\nfundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution. It does\nnot, however, follow from the above that if\nArticle 21\nhad not been\ndrafted and inserted in Part III, in that event it would have been\npermissible for the State to deprive a person of his life or liberty\nwithout the authority of law. No case has been cited before us to\nshow that before the coming into force of the Constitution or in\ncountries under rule of law where there is no provision\ncorresponding to\nArticle 21\n, a claim was ever sustained by the\ncourts that the State can deprive a person of his life or liberty without\nthe authority of law…”207\nThe remedy for the enforcement of the right to life or liberty would not stand\nsuspended even if the right to enforce\nArticle 21\nis suspended:\n“Recognition as fundamental right of one aspect of the pre-\nconstitutional right cannot have the effect of making things less\nfavourable so far as the sanctity of life and personal liberty is\n206\nIbid, at page 747 (para 525)\n207\nIbid, at pages 749-750 (para 530)\n117\nPART I\nconcerned compared to the position if an aspect of such right had\nnot been recognised as fundamental right because of the\nvulnerability of fundamental rights accruing from Article 359…”208\nJustice Khanna held that while wide powers to order preventive detention are vested\nin the State, there is no antithesis between the power to detain and power of the Court\nto examine the legality of such a detention:\n“The impact upon the individual of the massive and comprehensive\npowers of preventive detention with which the administrative\nofficers are armed has to be cushioned with legal safeguards\nagainst arbitrary deprivation of personal liberty if the premises of\nthe rule of law is not to lose its content and become\nmeaningless…”209\n119        The judgments rendered by all the four judges constituting the majority in ADM\nJabalpur are seriously flawed. Life and personal liberty are inalienable to human\nexistence. These rights are, as recognised in Kesavananda Bharati, primordial\nrights. They constitute rights under natural law. The human element in the life of the\nindividual is integrally founded on the sanctity of life. Dignity is associated with liberty\nand freedom. No civilized state can contemplate an encroachment upon life and\npersonal liberty without the authority of law. Neither life nor liberty are bounties\nconferred by the state nor does the Constitution create these rights. The right to life\nhas existed even before the advent of the Constitution. In recognising the right, the\nConstitution does not become the sole repository of the right.                             It would be\npreposterous to suggest that a democratic Constitution without a Bill of Rights would\nleave individuals governed by the state without either the existence of the right to live\n208\nIbid, at page 751 (para 531)\n209\nIbid, page 767 (para 574)\n118\nPART I\nor the means of enforcement of the right. The right to life being inalienable to each\nindividual, it existed prior to the Constitution and continued in force under\nArticle 372\nof the Constitution. Justice Khanna was clearly right in holding that the recognition of\nthe right to life and personal liberty under the Constitution does not denude the\nexistence of that right, apart from it nor can there be a fatuous assumption that in\nadopting the Constitution the people of India surrendered the most precious aspect of\nthe human persona, namely, life, liberty and freedom to the state on whose mercy\nthese rights would depend. Such a construct is contrary to the basic foundation of the\nrule of law which imposes restraints upon the powers vested in the modern state when\nit deals with the liberties of the individual. The power of the Court to issue a Writ of\nHabeas Corpus is a precious and undeniable feature of the rule of law.\n120    A constitutional democracy can survive when citizens have an undiluted\nassurance that the rule of law will protect their rights and liberties against any invasion\nby the state and that judicial remedies would be available to ask searching questions\nand expect answers when a citizen has been deprived of these, most precious rights.\nThe view taken by Justice Khanna must be accepted, and accepted in reverence for\nthe strength of its thoughts and the courage of its convictions.\n121    When histories of nations are written and critiqued, there are judicial decisions\nat the forefront of liberty. Yet others have to be consigned to the archives, reflective\n119\nPART I\nof what was, but should never have been. The decision of the US Supreme Court in\nBuck v Bell210 ranks amongst the latter. It was a decision in which Justice Oliver\nWendell Holmes Jr. accepted the forcible sterilization by tubular ligation of Carrie\nBucks as part of a programme of state sponsored eugenic sterilization. Justice\nHolmes, while upholding the programme opined that: “three generations of imbeciles\nis enough”211. In the same vein was the decision of the US Supreme Court in\nKorematsu v United States212, upholding the imprisonment of a citizen in a\nconcentration camp solely because of his Japanese ancestry.\nADM Jabalpur must be and is accordingly overruled.\nWe also overrule the decision\nin\nUnion of India v Bhanudas Krishna Gawde213\n, which followed ADM Jabalpur.\n122     In\nI R Coelho v State of Tamil Nadu214\n, this Court took the view that ADM\nJabalpur has been impliedly overruled by various subsequent decisions:\n“During Emergency, the fundamental rights were read even more\nrestrictively as interpreted by the majority in\nADM, Jabalpur v.\nShivakant Shukla\n[(1976) 2 SCC 521]. The decision in ADM,\nJabalpur [(1976) 2 SCC 521] about the restrictive reading of right to\nlife and liberty stood impliedly overruled by various subsequent\ndecisions.”215\n210\n274 US 200 (1927)\n211\nA moving account of the times and the position is to be found in Siddhartha Mukherjee, The Gene: An Intimate\nHistory, Penguin Books Ltd.

The Delhi High Court, however, clarified that Section 377 will continue\nto govern non-consensual penile, non-vaginal sex and penile non-vaginal sex\ninvolving minors. Among the grounds of challenge was that the statutory provision\nconstituted an infringement of the rights to dignity and privacy. The Delhi High Court\nheld that:\n“…The sphere of privacy allows persons to develop human\nrelations without interference from the outside community or from\n216\n(\n2014) 1 SCC 1\n217\nNaz Foundation v Government of NCT\n, 2010 Cri LJ 94\n121\nPART I\nthe State. The exercise of autonomy enables an individual to attain\nfulfilment, grow in self-esteem, build relationships of his or her\nchoice and fulfil all legitimate goals that he or she may set. In the\nIndian Constitution, the right to live with dignity and the right of\nprivacy both are recognised as dimensions of Article 21…”218\nSection 377 was held to be a denial of the dignity of an individual and to criminalise\nhis or her core identity solely on account of sexuality would violate\nArticle 21.\nThe\nHigh Court adverted at length to global trends in the protection of privacy – dignity\nrights of homosexuals, including decisions emanating from the US Supreme Court,\nthe South African Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The\nview of the High Court was that a statutory provision targeting homosexuals as a class\nviolates\nArticle 14\n, and amounted to a hostile discrimination on the grounds of sexual\norientation (outlawed by\nArticle 15\n). The High Court, however, read down Section 377\nin the manner which has been adverted to above.\n125        When the matter travelled to this Court, Justice Singhvi, speaking for the Bench\ndealt with several grounds including the one based on privacy – dignity. The Court\nrecognised that the right to privacy which is recognised by\nArticle 12\nof the Universal\nDeclaration and\nArticle 17\nof ICCPR has been read into\nArticle 21\n“through expansive\nreading of the right to life and liberty”. This Court, however, found fault with the basis\nof the judgment of the High Court for the following, among other reasons:\n“…the Division Bench of the High Court overlooked that a\nminiscule fraction of the country's population constitutes\n218\nIbid, at page 110 (para 48)\n122\nPART I\nlesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders and in last more\nthan 150 years less than 200 persons have been prosecuted\n(as per the reported orders) for committing offence under\nSection\n377\nIPC and this cannot be made sound basis for declaring that\nsection ultra vires the provisions of\nArticles 14\n, 15\nand\n21\nof the\nConstitution.”219 (emphasis supplied)\nThe privacy and dignity based challenge was repelled with the following observations:\n“In its anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT persons\nand to declare that\nSection 377\nIPC violates the right to\nprivacy, autonomy and dignity, the High Court has extensively\nrelied upon the judgments of other jurisdictions. Though these\njudgments shed considerable light on various aspects of this right\nand are informative in relation to the plight of sexual minorities, we\nfeel that they cannot be applied blindfolded for deciding the\nconstitutionality of the law enacted by the Indian Legislature.”220\n(emphasis supplied)\n126        Neither of the above reasons can be regarded as a valid constitutional basis\nfor disregarding a claim based on privacy under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. That\n“a miniscule fraction of the country’s population constitutes lesbians, gays, bisexuals\nor transgenders” (as observed in the judgment of this Court) is not a sustainable basis\nto deny the right to privacy. The purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of\nguaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of\nmajorities, whether legislative or popular. The guarantee of constitutional rights does\nnot depend upon their exercise being favourably regarded by majoritarian opinion.\nThe test of popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which\nare conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection.                  Discrete and insular\n219\nKoushal\n(Supra note 216), at page 69-70 (para 66)\n220\nIbid, at page 78 (para 77)\n123\nPART I\nminorities face grave dangers of discrimination for the simple reason that their views,\nbeliefs or way of life does not accord with the ‘mainstream’. Yet in a democratic\nConstitution founded on the rule of law, their rights are as sacred as those conferred\non other citizens to protect their freedoms and liberties. Sexual orientation is an\nessential attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual on the basis of\nsexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual.\nEquality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be\nprotected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual\norientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by\nArticles 14\n, 15\nand\n21\nof the Constitution.\n127   The view in Koushal that the High Court had erroneously relied upon\ninternational precedents “in its anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT.\npersons” is similarly, in our view, unsustainable. The rights of the lesbian, gay,\nbisexual and transgender population cannot be construed to be “so-called rights”. The\nexpression “so-called” seems to suggest the exercise of a liberty in the garb of a right\nwhich is illusory. This is an inappropriate construction of the privacy based claims of\nthe LGBT population. Their rights are not “so-called” but are real rights founded on\nsound constitutional doctrine. They inhere in the right to life. They dwell in privacy and\ndignity. They constitute the essence of liberty and freedom. Sexual orientation is an\nessential component of identity. Equal protection demands protection of the identity\nof every individual without discrimination.\n124\nPART I\n128   The decision in Koushal presents a de minimis rationale when it asserts that\nthere have been only two hundred prosecutions for violating Section 377. The de\nminimis hypothesis is misplaced because the invasion of a fundamental right is not\nrendered tolerable when a few, as opposed to a large number of persons, are\nsubjected to hostile treatment. The reason why such acts of hostile discrimination are\nconstitutionally impermissible is because of the chilling effect which they have on the\nexercise of the fundamental right in the first place. For instance, pre-publication\nrestraints such as censorship are vulnerable because they discourage people from\nexercising their right to free speech because of the fear of a restraint coming into\noperation. The chilling effect on the exercise of the right poses a grave danger to the\nunhindered fulfilment of one’s sexual orientation, as an element of privacy and dignity.\nThe chilling effect is due to the danger of a human being subjected to social\nopprobrium or disapproval, as reflected in the punishment of crime. Hence the\nKoushal rationale that prosecution of a few is not an index of violation is flawed and\ncannot be accepted. Consequently, we disagree with the manner in which Koushal\nhas dealt with the privacy – dignity based claims of LGBT persons on this aspect.\nSince the challenge to Section 377 is pending consideration before a larger Bench of\nthis Court, we would leave the constitutional validity to be decided in an appropriate\nproceeding.\n125\nPART J\nJ          India’s commitments under International law\n129        The recognition of privacy as a fundamental constitutional value is part of\nIndia’s commitment to a global human rights regime.\nArticle 51\nof the Constitution,\nwhich forms part of the Directive Principles, requires the State to endeavour to “foster\nrespect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised\npeoples with one another”221.\nArticle 12\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nrecognises the right to privacy:\n“Article 12: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with\nhis privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon\nhis honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection\nof the law against such interference or attacks.”\nSimilarly, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was adopted on 16\nDecember 1979 and came into effect on 23 March 1976. India ratified it on 11\nDecember 1977.\nArticle 17\nof the ICCPR provides thus:\n“The obligations imposed by this article require the State to adopt\nlegislative and other measures to give effect to the prohibition\nagainst such interferences and attacks as well as to the protection\nof the right.”\nThe Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993\nwhich has been enacted by Parliament\nrefers to the ICCPR as a human rights instrument.\nSection 2(1)(d)\ndefines human\nrights:\n221\nArticle 51(c)\nof the Indian Constitution\n126\nPART J\n“human rights” means the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and\ndignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied\nin the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India.”\nSection 2(1)(f)\ndefines International Covenants:\n“International Covenants” means the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural rights adopted by the General\nAssembly of the United Nations on the 16th December, 1966 [and\nsuch other Covenant or Convention adopted by the General\nAssembly of the United Nations as the Central Government may,\nby notification, specify”\nUnder\nSection 12(f)\nof the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, the National Human\nRights Commission:\n“is entrusted with the function of studying treaties and other\ninternational instruments on human rights and make\nrecommendations for their effective implementation.”\n130    The ICCPR casts an obligation on states to respect, protect and fulfil its norms.\nThe duty of a State to respect mandates that it must not violate the right. The duty to\nprotect mandates that the government must protect it against interference by private\nparties.   The duty to fulfil postulates that government must take steps towards\nrealisation of a right. While elaborating the rights under\nArticle 17\n, general comment\n16 specifically stipulates that:\n“…..there is universal recognition of the fundamental importance,\nand enduring relevance, of the right to privacy and of the need to\nensure that it is safeguarded, in law and practice.”\n127\nPART J\nSignificantly, while acceding to the ICCPR, India did not file any reservation or\ndeclaration to\nArticle 17.\nWhile India filed reservations against\nArticles 1\n, 9\nand\n13\n,\nthere was none to\nArticle 17:\n“Article 1 refers to the right to self-determination. The reservation to\nArticle 1\nstates that “the Government of the Republic of India\ndeclares that the words ‘the right of self-determination’ appearing in\n[this article] apply only to the peoples under foreign domination and\nthat these words do not apply to sovereign independent States or\nto a section of a people or nation-which is the essence of national\nintegrity. ‘ The reservation to\nArticle 9\n, which refers to the right to\nliberty and security of person, detention and compensation payable\non wrongful arrest or detention, states that “the government of the\nRepublic of India takes the position that the provisions of the article\nshall be so applied as to be in consonance with the provisions of\nclauses (3) to (7) of\narticle 22\nof the Constitution of India. Further\nunder the Indian Legal System, there is no enforceable right to\ncompensation for persons claiming to be victims of unlawful arrest\nor detention against the State.” The reservation to\nArticle 13\n– which\nrefers to protections for aliens, states that “the Government of the\nRepublic of India reserves its right to apply its law relating to\nforeigners.”\nOn 30 June 2014, a report was presented by the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights.222 The report underscores that:\n“…there is universal recognition of the fundamental importance,\nand enduring relevance, of the right to privacy and of the need to\nensure that it is safeguarded, in law and in practice.”223\n222\n“The Right to privacy in the Digital age”, Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights (30 June 2014)\n223\nIbid, at page 5 (para 13)\n128\nPART J\n131     In\nBachan Singh v State of Punjab224 (“Bachan Singh”\n), this Court\nconsidered in relation to the death penalty, the obligations assumed by India in\ninternational law, following the ratification of the ICCPR. The Court held that the\nrequirements of\nArticle 6\nof the ICCPR are substantially similar to the guarantees\ncontained in\nArticles 20\nand\n21\nof the Constitution. The penal law of India was held to\nbe in accord with its international commitments. In Francis Coralie, this Court, while\nexplaining the ambit of\nArticle 21\n, held that:\n“…there is implicit in\nArticle 21\nthe right to protection against torture\nor cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in\nArticle 5\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\nguaranteed by\nArticle 7\nof the International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights…”225\n132     In\nVishaka v State of Rajasthan226\n, this Court observed that in the absence of\ndomestic law, the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women\n(CEDAW) is applicable. In NALSA, while dealing with the rights of transgenders, this\nCourt found that the international conventions were not inconsistent with the\nfundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and must be recognised and\nfollowed.\n133     The position in law is well settled. Where there is a contradiction between\ninternational law and a domestic statute, the Court would give effect to the latter.\nIn\n224\n(1980) 2\nSCC 684\n225\nFrancis Coralie\n(Supra note 159), at page 619 (para 8)\n226\n(1997) 6 SCC 241\n129\nPART K\nthe present case, there is no contradiction between the international obligations which\nhave been assumed by India and the Constitution. The Court will not readily presume\nany inconsistency. On the contrary, constitutional provisions must be read and\ninterpreted in a manner which would enhance their conformity with the global human\nrights regime. India is a responsible member of the international community and the\nCourt must adopt an interpretation which abides by the international commitments\nmade by the country particularly where its constitutional and statutory mandates\nindicate no deviation. In fact, the enactment of the\nHuman Rights Act\nby Parliament\nwould indicate a legislative desire to implement the human rights regime founded on\nconstitutional values and international conventions acceded to by India.\nK       Comparative Law\n134     This section analyses the evolution of the concept of privacy in other\njurisdictions from a comparative law perspective. The Court is conscious of the limits\nof a comparative approach. Each country is governed by its own constitutional and\nlegal structure. Constitutional structures have an abiding connection with the history,\nculture, political doctrine and values which a society considers as its founding\nprinciples. Foreign judgments must hence be read with circumspection ensuring that\nthe text is not read isolated from its context. The countries which have been dealt with\nare:\n(i)     United Kingdom;\n(ii)    United States;\n(iii)   South Africa; and\n130\nPART K\n(iv)      Canada.\nThe narrative will then proceed to examine the decisions of the European Court of\nHuman Rights, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Inter-American\nCourt of Human Rights. These decisions are indicative of the manner in which the\nright to privacy has been construed in diverse jurisdictions based on the histories of\nthe societies they govern and the challenges before them.\n(i) U K decisions\nThe first common law case regarding protection of privacy is said to be Semayne’s\nCase227 (1604). The case related to the entry into a property by the Sheriff of London\nin order to execute a valid writ. The case is famous for the words of Sir Edward Coke:\n“That the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as\nwell for his defence against injury and violence, as for his repose …”\nThen, in the case of Entick v Carrington228 (1765), Entick’s house had been forcibly\nentered into by agents of the State/King. Lord Camden CJ held that:\n“By the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it\never so minute, is a trespass. No man can set his foot upon my\nground without my licence, but he is liable to an action, though the\ndamage be nothing; which is proved by every declaration in\ntrespass, where the defendant is called upon to answer for bruising\nthe grass and even treading upon the soil.”\n227\nPeter Semayne v Richard Gresham, 77 ER 194\n228\n(1765) 19 St. Tr. 1029\n131\nPART K\nPrivacy jurisprudence developed further in the 19th century. In 1849, in Prince Albert\nv Strange229 (1849), publication was sought to be restrained of otherwise unpublished\nprivate etchings and lists of works done by Prince Albert and Queen Victoria. In the\nHigh Court of Chancery, Lord Cottenham observed that:\n“… where privacy is the right invaded, postponing the injunction\nwould be equivalent to denying it altogether. The interposition of\nthis Court in these cases does not depend upon any legal right, and\nto be effectual, it must be immediate.”\nHowever, the approach adopted by the Court in Prince Albert case took a different\nturn in the case of Kaye v Robertson230 (1991). In this case, when the appellant, after\nan accident, was recovering from brain surgery in a private hospital room, two\njournalists posed as doctors and took photographs of him. The appellant attempted to\nobtain an order to restrain publication of the photographs. The Court of Appeal held\nthat:\n“… in English law there is no right to privacy, and accordingly there\nis no right of action for breach of a person's privacy”\nThe decision in R v Director of Serious Fraud Office, ex parte Smith 231 (1993)\ndiscussed the question of the right to silence. The applicant (the chairman and\nmanaging director of a company) was charged of doing acts with the intent to defraud\nits creditors. After having been cautioned, he was asked to answer questions of the\nDirector of the Serious Fraud Office. The issue was whether the requirement to\n229\n(1849) 41 ER 1171\n230\n[1991] FSR 62\n231\n[1993] AC 1\n132\nPART K\nanswer questions infringed the right to silence. It was held that the powers of the\nDirector of the Serious Fraud Office, under the Criminal Justice Act 1987, entitled\nhim/her to compel the applicant to answer questions on pain of commission of a\ncriminal offence. Lord Mustill, who delivered the leading opinion of the Court, held\nthat:\n“[It] is a simple reflection of the common view that one person\nshould so far as possible be entitled to tell another person to mind\nhis own business. All civilised states recognise this assertion of\npersonal liberty and privacy. Equally, although there may be\npronounced disagreements between states, and between individual\ncitizens within states, about where the line should be drawn, few\nwould dispute that some curtailment of the liberty is indispensable\nto the stability of society; and indeed in the United Kingdom today\nour lives are permeated by enforceable duties to provide\ninformation on demand, created by Parliament and tolerated by the\nmajority, albeit in some cases with reluctance.”\nLord Mustill’s statement “underlines the approach taken by the common law to\nprivacy” that “it recognised privacy as a principle of general value” and that “privacy\nhad only been given discrete and specific protection at common law”.232\nThis approach was diluted in the case of Wainwright v Home Office233(2004), where\na mother and son were subjected to a strip-search when visiting a prison in 1997, in\naccordance with existing Prison Rules. The son, who was mentally impaired and\nsuffered from cerebral palsy, later developed post-traumatic stress disorder. Claims\nfor damages arising from trespass and trespass to the person were issued. At the time\n232\nLord Neuberger, “Privacy in the 21st Century”, UK Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists' Lecture (28\nNovember 2012)\n233\n[2004] 2 AC 406\n133\nPART K\nof the incident, the\nHuman Rights Act, 1998\n(HRA) had not yet come into force. When\nthe case reached before House of Lords, it was argued that “the law of tort should\ngive a remedy for any kind of distress caused by an infringement of the right of privacy\nprotected by\narticle 8\nof the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights”.\nIt was further argued that reliance must be placed upon the judgment of Sedley LJ in\nDouglas v Hello! Ltd234 (2001), where it was said that:\n\"What a concept of privacy does, however, is accord\nrecognition to the fact that the law has to protect not only those\npeople whose trust has been abused but those who simply find\nthemselves subjected to an unwanted intrusion into their\npersonal lives. The law no longer needs to construct an artificial\nrelationship of confidentiality between intruder and victim: it can\nrecognise privacy itself as a legal principle drawn from the\nfundamental value of personal autonomy.\" (emphasis supplied)\nHowever, Lord Hoffman in Wainwright rejected all the contentions and held that:\n“I do not understand Sedley LJ to have been advocating the\ncreation of a high-level principle of invasion of privacy. His\nobservations are in my opinion no more (although certainly no less)\nthan a plea for the extension and possibly renaming of the old action\nfor breach of confidence.”\nLord Hoffman also observed that:\n“What the courts have so far refused to do is to formulate a general\nprinciple of “invasion of privacy” …\nThere seems to me a great difference between identifying privacy\nas a value which underlies the existence of a rule of law (and may\npoint the direction in which the law should develop) and privacy as\na principle of law in itself. The English common law is familiar with\n234\n[2001] QB 967\n134\nPART K\nthe notion of underlying values - principles only in the broadest\nsense - which direct its development…\nNor is there anything in the jurisprudence of the European Court of\nHuman Rights which suggests that the adoption of some high level\nprinciple of privacy is necessary to comply with\narticle 8\nof the\nConvention. The European Court is concerned only with whether\nEnglish law provides an adequate remedy in a specific case in\nwhich it considers that there has been an invasion of privacy\ncontrary to\narticle 8(1)\nand not justifiable under\narticle 8(2)\n.”\nThere has been a transformation in this approach after the\nHuman Rights Act, 1998\n(HRA) came into force. For the first time, privacy was incorporated as a right under\nthe British law.235 In Campbell v MGN236 (2004), a well-known model was\nphotographed leaving a rehabilitation clinic, following public denials that she was a\nrecovering drug addict. The photographs were published in a publication run by MGN.\nShe sought damages under the English law through her lawyers to bring a claim for\nbreach of confidence engaging\nSection 6\nof the Human Rights Act. The House of\nLords by majority decided in her favour. Lord Hope writing for the majority held:\n“[I]f there is an intrusion in a situation where a person can\nreasonably expect his privacy to be respected, that intrusion will be\ncapable of giving rise to liability unless the intrusion can be\njustified… [A] duty of confidence arises when confidential\ninformation comes to the knowledge of a person where he has\nnotice that the information is confidential.”\n235\nThe UK Human Rights Act incorporates the rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights\n(ECHR) into domestic British law. The Preamble of the Act states that it “gives further effect to rights and\nfreedoms guaranteed” under the ECHR.\nUnder the Act\n(\nS. 6\n), it is unlawful for any public authority, including a\ncourt or tribunal at any level, to act in a manner which is incompatible with a Convention right. The Convention\nrights take precedence over rules of common law or equity, and over most subordinate legislations.\nThe Act\n,\nthereby, protects the right to privacy, which has been provided under\nArticle 8 (1)\nof the ECHR. See Ben\nEmmerson et al. (ed), Human Rights and Criminal Justice, Sweet & Maxwell (2000).

But if there is a relevant cause of action\napplicable, the court as a public authority must act compatibly with both\nparties' Convention rights.\nIn a case such as this, the relevant vehicle\nwill usually be the action for breach of confidence, as Lord Woolf CJ\nheld in\nA v B\nplc [2002] EWCA Civ 337, [2003] QB 195, 202, para 4 :\n\"[\nArticles 8\nand\n10]\nhave provided new parameters\nwithin which the court will decide, in an action for\nbreach of confidence, whether a person is entitled\nto have his privacy protected by the court or\nwhether the restriction of freedom of expression\nwhich such protection involves cannot be justified.\nThe court's approach to the issues which the\napplications raise has been modified because,\nunder\nsection 6\nof the 1998 Act, the court, as a\npublic authority, is required not to 'act in a way\nwhich is incompatible with a Convention right'. The\ncourt is able to achieve this by absorbing the rights\nwhich\narticles 8\nand\n10\nprotect into the long-\nestablished action for breach of confidence. This\ninvolves giving a new strength and breadth to the\naction so that it accommodates the requirements of\nthese articles.\"\n237\n[2003] QB 195\n136\nPART K\nLater, in Douglas v Hello! Ltd238, it was held that:\n“What the House [in Campbell] was agreed upon was that the\nknowledge, actual or imputed, that information is private will\nnormally impose on anyone publishing that information the duty to\njustify what, in the absence of justification, will be a wrongful\ninvasion of privacy.”\nSubsequent cases establish the contribution the HRA has made in jurisprudence on\nprivacy in the UK. In Associated Newspapers Limited v His Royal Highness the\nPrince of Wales239 (2006), an appeal was made against the judgment in respect of\nthe claim of Prince Charles for breach of confidence and infringement of copyright.\nThe case brought about when ‘The Mail on Sunday’ published extracts of a dispatch\nby the Prince of Wales. The Court held that:\n“The information at issue in this case is private information, public\ndisclosure of which constituted an interference with Prince Charles’\nArticle 8\nrights. As heir to the throne, Prince Charles is an important\npublic figure. In respect of such persons the public takes an interest\nin information about them that is relatively trivial. For this reason\npublic disclosure of such information can be particularly intrusive…\nPrince Charles has a valid claim based on breach of confidence and\ninterference with his\nArticle 8\nrights.”\nIn Murray v Big Pictures (UK) Ltd240 (2008), a photographer had taken a series of\nphotographs of a writer’s infant son, which were later published in a newspaper. The\nissue was whether there was misuse of private information by taking photographs. It\nwas held that:\n238\n[2006] QB 125\n239\n[2006] EWCA Civ 1776\n240\n[2008] 3 WLR 1360\n137\nPART K\n“[The] question of whether there is a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy is a broad one, which takes account of all the circumstances\nof the case. They include the attributes of the claimant, the nature\nof the activity in which the claimant was engaged, the place at which\nit was happening, the nature and purpose of the intrusion, the\nabsence of consent and whether it was known or could be inferred,\nthe effect on the claimant and the circumstances in which and the\npurposes for which the information came into the hands of the\npublisher… [I]t is at least arguable that David had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. The fact that he is a child is in our view of\ngreater significance than the judge thought.”\nR v The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis241\n(2011) was a case concerning\nthe extent of the police's power (under guidelines issued by the Association of Chief\nPolice Officers- the ACPO guidelines) to indefinitely retain biometric data associated\nwith individuals who are no longer suspected of a criminal offence. The UK Supreme\nCourt, by a majority held that the police force's policy of retaining DNA evidence in the\nabsence of 'exceptional circumstances' was unlawful and a violation of\nArticle 8\nof the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights. Lord Dyson, on behalf of the majority, held\nthat:\n“It is important that, in such an important and sensitive area as the\nretention of biometric data by the police, the court reflects its\ndecision by making a formal order to declare what it considers to be\nthe true legal position. But it is not necessary to go further.\nSection\n8(1)\nof the HRA gives the court a wide discretion to grant such relief\nor remedy within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.\nSince Parliament is already seized of the matter, it is neither just\nnor appropriate to make an order requiring a change in the\nlegislative scheme within a specific period…\n241\n[2011] UKSC 21\n138\nPART K\n….he present ACPO guidelines are unlawful because they are\nincompatible with\narticle 8\nof the ECHR. I would grant no other\nrelief.”\nIn the matter of an application by JR38 for Judicial Review (Northern Ireland) 242\n(2015), the Appellant was involved in rioting in 2010, when still only 14 years of age.\nThe police, in order to identify those responsible, and for the sake of deterrence,\npublished CCTV footage depicting the Appellant in two newspapers. The issue\ninvolved was: “Whether the publication of photographs by the police to identify a young\nperson suspected of being involved in riotous behaviour and attempted criminal damage\ncan ever be a necessary and proportionate interference with that person’s\narticle 8\nrights?” The majority held that\nArticle 8\nwas not engaged, as there was no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the case. Lord Toulson (with whom Lord Hodge agreed), while\nstating that the conduct of the police did not amount, prima facie, to an interference with\nthe appellant’s right to respect for his private life, held that:\n“The reasonable or legitimate expectation test is an objective test.\nIt is to be applied broadly, taking account of all the circumstances\nof the case (as Sir Anthony Clarke said in Murray’s case) and having\nregard to underlying value or values to be protected. Thus, for\nexample, the publication of a photograph of a young person acting\nin a criminal manner for the purpose of enabling the police to\ndiscover his identity may not fall within the scope of the protection\nof personal autonomy which is the purpose of\narticle 8\n, but the\npublication of the same photograph for another purpose might.”\n242\n[2015] UKSC 42\n139\nPART K\nLord Clarke wrote a separate judgment concurring with Lord Toulson and held that:\n“… the criminal nature of what the appellant was doing was not an\naspect of his private life that he was entitled to keep private. He\ncould not have had an objectively reasonable expectation that such\nphotographs, taken for the limited purpose of identifying who he\nwas, would not be published.”\nThe decision in PJS v News Group Newspapers Ltd243 (2016) dealt with an\nanonymised privacy injunction244. The injunction was sought by the claimant to\nrestrain publication of details of his sexual relationship with two other people, on the\nground that the publication would breach his rights to privacy and confidentiality,\nprotected by\nArticle 8\nof ECHR. The UK Supreme Court by majority ruled in favour\nof the applicant. Speaking on behalf of the majority, Lord Mance held that:\n“… having regard to the nature of the material sought to be\npublished and the identity and financial circumstances of the\nappellant, that the appellant’s real concern is indeed with the\ninvasion of privacy that would be involved in further disclosure and\npublication in the English media, and that any award of damages,\nhowever assessed, would be an inadequate remedy.”\nThe HRA has rendered clarity on the existence of a right to privacy in UK\njurisprudence and substantially resolved conflicting approaches regarding privacy in\ndecided cases. The HRA, by incorporating the provisions of the European\n243\n[2016] UKSC 26\n244\nIn English law, an anonymised injunction is “an interim injunction which restrains a person from publishing\ninformation which concerns the applicant and is said to be confidential or private where the names of either\nor both of the parties to the proceedings are not stated”. See “Report of the Committee on Super-Injunctions:\nSuper-Injunctions, Anonymised Injunctions and Open Justice” (2011), available online at\nhttps://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Reports/super-injunction-report-\n20052011.pdf\n140\nPART K\nConvention on Human Rights (ECHR), has adopted the guarantee of the right to\nprivacy into UK domestic law. The Convention, together with its adoption into\ndomestic legislation, has led to a considerable change in the development of\nprotection of human privacy in English law.\n(ii) US Supreme Court decisions\nThe US Constitution does not contain an express right to privacy. But American\nprivacy jurisprudence reflects that it has been protected under several amendments245\nof the US Constitution.\nAs early as 1886, in Boyd v United States246, the question before the US Supreme\nCourt was whether compulsory production of a person’s private papers to be used in\nevidence against him in a judicial proceeding, is an unreasonable search and seizure\nwithin the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Justice Bradley delivered the opinion\nof the Court and held as follows:\n“The principles laid down in this opinion affect the very essence of\nconstitutional liberty and security… they apply to all invasions\non the part of the government and its employees of the sanctity\nof a man's home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking\nof his doors and the rummaging of his drawers that constitutes\nthe essence of the offence, but it is the invasion of his\nindefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty, and\nprivate property, -- it is the invasion of this sacred right ...\n245\nThe concept of privacy plays a major role in the jurisprudence of the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth\nAmendments. The Ninth Amendment has also been interpreted to justify broadly reading the Bill of Rights to\nprotect privacy in ways not specifically provided in the first eight amendments.\n246\n116 US 616 (1886)\n141\nPART K\nAnd any compulsory discovery by extorting the party's oath, or\ncompelling the production of his private books and papers, to\nconvict him of crime or to forfeit his property, is contrary to the\nprinciples of a free government... It may suit the purposes of\ndespotic power, but it cannot abide the pure atmosphere of political\nliberty and personal freedom.” (emphasis supplied)\nIn two decisions in the 1920s, the Court read the Fourteenth Amendment’s liberty to\nprohibit states from making laws interfering with the private decisions of parents and\neducators to shape the education of their children. In Meyer v Nebraska247 (1923),\nthe Court struck down a state law that prohibited the teaching of foreign languages to\nstudents that had not yet completed the eighth grade. The Court in a 7:2 decision,\nwritten by Justice McReynolds, concluded that the state failed to show a compelling\nneed to infringe upon the rights of parents and teachers to decide on the best course\nof education for young students. On liberty, Justice McReynolds held:\n“Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint, but\nalso the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common\noccupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a\nhome and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of\nhis own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long\nrecognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness\nby free men. The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be\ninterfered with, under the guise of protecting the public interest, by\nlegislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some\npurpose within the competency of the State to effect.”\n247\n262 US 390 (1923)\n142\nPART K\nTwo years later, in Pierce v Society of Sisters248 (1925), the Court, relying upon\nMayer v Nebraska, struck down the Oregon Compulsory Education Act, which\nmandated all children (between eight and sixteen years) to attend public schools. It\nwas held the said statute is an “unreasonable interference with the liberty of the\nparents and guardians to direct the upbringing of the children, and in that respect\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment”.\nIn Olmstead v United States249 (1928), the question before the Court was whether\nthe use of evidence of private telephone conversations, intercepted by means of\nwiretapping amounted to a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. In a 5:4\ndecision, it was held that there was no violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\nChief Justice Taft wrote the majority judgment, holding that:\n“The Amendment itself shows that the search is to be of material\nthings -- the person, the house, his papers, or his effects…. The\nAmendment does not forbid what was done here. There was no\nsearching. There was no seizure. The evidence was secured by the\nuse of the sense of hearing, and that only. There was no entry of\nthe houses or offices of the defendants.”\nHowever, Justice Louis Brandeis wrote a dissenting opinion and observed that:\n“… time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and\npurposes.\" Subtler and more far-reaching means of invading\nprivacy have become available to the Government. Discovery and\ninvention have made it possible for the Government, by means far\nmore effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in\ncourt of what is whispered in the closet. Moreover, “in the\n248\n(268) US 510 (1925)\n249\n277 US 438 (1928)\n143\nPART K\napplication of a constitution, our contemplation cannot be only\nof what has, been but of what may be.” The progress of science\nin furnishing the Government with means of espionage is not likely\nto stop with wiretapping. Ways may someday be developed by\nwhich the Government, without removing papers from secret\ndrawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be\nenabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the\nhome. Advances in the psychic and related sciences may bring\nmeans of exploring unexpressed beliefs, thoughts and emotions…”\n(emphasis supplied)\nHe questioned whether the Constitution affords no protection against such invasions\nof individual security. Justice Brandeis answers this question in a celebrated passage:\n“The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions\nfavorable to the pursuit of happiness. They sought to protect\nAmericans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their\nsensations. They conferred, as against the Government, the\nright to be let alone -- the most comprehensive of rights, and\nthe right most valued by civilized men. To protect that right,\nevery unjustifiable intrusion by the Government upon the privacy of\nthe individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment...” (emphasis supplied)\nThe Court, in the case of Griswold v Connecticut250 (1965), invalidated a state law\nprohibiting the possession, sale, and distribution of contraceptives to married couples,\nfor the reason that the law violated the right to marital privacy. Justice Douglas, who\ndelivered the main opinion, observed that this right emanated from “penumbras” of\nthe fundamental constitutional guarantees and rights in the Bill of Rights, which\ntogether create “zones of privacy”. Accordingly, it was held that:\n250\n381 US 479 (1965)\n144\nPART K\n“The present case, then concerns a relationship lying within the\nzone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional\nguarantees… Would we allow the police to search the sacred\nprecincts of marital bedrooms of telltale signs of the use of\ncontraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy\nsurrounding the marriage relationship.”\nJustice Goldberg wrote in the concurring opinion that:\n“The fact that no particular provision of the Constitution explicitly\nforbids the State from disrupting the traditional relation of the family\n-- a relation as old and as fundamental as our entire civilization --\nsurely does not show that the Government was meant to have the\npower to do so. Rather, as the Ninth Amendment expressly\nrecognizes, there are fundamental personal rights such as this one,\nwhich are protected from abridgment by the Government, though\nnot specifically mentioned in the Constitution.”\nThe 1967 decision in Katz v United States251 (“Katz”) overruled Olmstead v United\nStates (supra) and revolutionized the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment\nregarding the extent to which a constitutional right to privacy applies against\ngovernment interference. In this case, Charles Katz was a gambler who used a public\ntelephone booth to transmit illegal wagers. Unbeknownst to Katz, the FBI which was\ninvestigating Katz’s activity, was recording his conversations via an electronic\neavesdropping device attached to the exterior of the phone booth. Subsequently, Katz\nwas convicted based on these recordings. He challenged his conviction, arguing that\nthe recordings were obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The\nconstitutional question in the case was whether the 4th Amendment protection from\n‘unreasonable searches and seizures’ was restricted to the search and seizure of\n251\n389 US 347 (1967)\n145\nPART K\ntangible property, or did it extend to intangible areas such as conversations overheard\nby others. It was held that the Government's eavesdropping activities violated the\nprivacy, upon which petitioner justifiably relied, while using the telephone booth, and\nthus constituted a “search and seizure” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,\nand that the Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends\nas well to the recording of oral statements.\nPrior to 1967 when determining the ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ for purposes\nof discussing Fourth Amendment violations, the analysis was focused on whether the\nauthority had trespassed on a private location. This ‘trespass doctrine’ was the\nprevailing test until Katz, which extended the protection of the Fourth Amendment\nfrom ‘places’ to ‘people’, affording individuals more privacy even in public. The\n‘trespass doctrine’ applied in Olmstead v United States (supra) was held to be no\nlonger relevant.\nJustice Stewart wrote the majority (7:1) opinion and held that:\n“One who occupies it [a telephone booth], shuts the door behind\nhim, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely\nentitled to assume that the words he utters into the\nmouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world. To read the\nConstitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the\npublic telephone has come to play in private communication.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nJustice Harlan wrote the concurring judgment holding that:\n“a) that an enclosed telephone booth is an area where, like a\nhome… a person has a constitutionally protected reasonable\nexpectation of privacy; (b) that electronic, as well as physical,\n146\nPART K\nintrusion into a place that is in this sense private may\nconstitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment....”\n(emphasis     supplied)\nThe reasonable expectation of privacy test was formulated as follows:\n“....the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\" The\nquestion, however, is what protection it affords to those\npeople. Generally, as here, the answer to that question requires\nreference to a \"place.\" My understanding of the rule that has\nemerged from prior decisions is that there is a twofold requirement,\nfirst that a person has exhibited an actual (subjective)\nexpectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be\none that society is prepared to recognize as \"reasonable.\"\nThus, a man's home is, for most purposes, a place where he\nexpects privacy, but objects, activities, or statements that he\nexposes to the \"plain view\" of outsiders are not \"protected,\"\nbecause no intention to keep them to himself has been\nexhibited. On the other hand, conversations in the open would\nnot be protected against being overheard, for the expectation\nof privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn Stanley v Georgia252 (1969), the Court analyzed the constitutionality of a statute\nimposing criminal sanctions upon the knowing possession of obscene matter. The\nCourt, in a unanimous decision, held that mere private possession of obscene matter\ncannot constitutionally be made a crime:\n“For also fundamental is the right to be free, except in very limited\ncircumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one's\nprivacy...\n[T]he rights that the appellant is asserting in the case before us...the\nright to read or observe what he pleases -- the right to satisfy his\nintellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his own\nhome…..the right to be free from state inquiry into the contents of\nhis library...\n252\n394 US 557 (1969)\n147\nPART K\nWhatever the power of the state to control public dissemination of\nideas inimical to the public morality, it cannot constitutionally\npremise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person's\nprivate thoughts.”\nSeven years after Griswold, the Court expanded the right to privacy beyond the\n‘marital bedroom’ to include unmarried persons. In Eisenstadt v Baird253 (1972), the\nCourt invalidated a law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried\npersons, ruling that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution:\n“It is true that in Griswold the right of privacy in question inhered in\nthe marital relationship. Yet the marital couple is not an independent\nentity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two\nindividuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup.\nIf the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual,\nmarried or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental\nintrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the\ndecision whether to bear or beget a child.”\nThe decision in Paris Adult Theatre I v Slaton254 (1973), upheld a state court's\ninjunction against the showing of obscene films in a movie theatre, restricted to\nconsenting adults. The Court distinguished the case from Stanley v Georgia (supra),\non the ground that the privacy of the home in Stanley was not the same as the\ncommercial exhibition of obscene movies in a theatre. Chief Justice Burger observed\nthat the prior decisions of the Supreme Court on the right to privacy only included\nthose personal rights that were “fundamental\" or “implicit in the concept of ordered\n253\n405 US 438 (1972)\n254\n413 US 49 (1973)\n148\nPART K\nliberty” such as “the personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage,\nmotherhood, procreation and childbearing” and held that:\n“Nothing, however, in this Court's decisions intimates that there is\nany \"fundamental\" privacy right \"implicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty\" to watch obscene movies in places of public\naccommodation… The idea of a \"privacy\" right and a place of public\naccommodation are, in this context, mutually exclusive.”\nIn the landmark decision on the right to abortion, Roe v Wade255 (1973), the Court\ndealt with the question of the right of an unmarried pregnant woman to terminate her\npregnancy by abortion. The constitutionality of a Texas Statute prohibiting abortions\nexcept with respect to those procured or admitted by medical advice for the purpose\nof saving the life of the mother was challenged on the ground that the law improperly\ninvaded the right and the choice of a pregnant woman to terminate her pregnancy and\nwas violative of the “liberty” guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment and the\nright to privacy recognized in Griswold. The Court ruled 7:2 that a right to privacy\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extended to a woman's\ndecision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's\ninterests in regulating abortions. Justice Blackmun delivered the majority judgment\nand held that:\n“The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of\nprivacy. In a line of decisions, however, the Court has\nrecognised that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of\ncertain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the\nConstitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices\nhave, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First\nAmendment; in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights; in the Ninth\n255\n410 US 113 (1973)\n149\nPART K\nAmendment; or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first\nsection of the Fourteenth Amendment...\nThis right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth\nAmendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions\nupon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court\ndetermined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to\nthe people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision\nwhether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” (emphasis supplied)\nThe right to privacy in bank records was analysed by the US Supreme Court in United\nStates v Miller256 (1976). In this case federal agents were investigating the defendant\nfor his involvement in a bootlegging conspiracy. The agents subpoenaed two banks\nand received his bank records. As a result, he was indicted. The question was whether\nan individual reasonably can expect that records kept incidental to his personal\nbanking transactions will be protected from uncontrolled government inspection. In a\n6:3 opinion, the Supreme Court held that a bank depositor has no Fourth Amendment\ninterest in the records that his bank is required to keep in compliance with the Bank\nSecrecy Act of 1970, and that Miller had no right to privacy in his bank records. Writing\nfor the majority, Justice Lewis F. Powell asserted that the “documents subpoenaed...\nare not [Miller’s] ‘private papers’,” but instead, part of the bank’s business records. It\nwas held:\n“There is no legitimate \"expectation of privacy\" in the contents\nof the original checks and deposit slips, since the checks are\nnot confidential communications, but negotiable instruments\nto be used in commercial transactions, and all the documents\nobtained contain only information voluntarily conveyed to the banks\nand exposed to their employees in the ordinary course of business.\n256\n425 US 435 (1976)\n150\nPART K\nThe Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of\ninformation revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to\nGovernment authorities.\nThe Act\n's recordkeeping requirements do\nnot alter these considerations so as to create a protectable Fourth\nAmendment interest of a bank depositor in the bank's records of his\naccount.”\nHowever, Justice Brennan dissented and held that:\n“A bank customer's reasonable expectation is that, absent a\ncompulsion by legal process, the matters he reveals to the bank will\nbe utilized by the bank only for internal banking purposes... [A]\ndepositor reveals many aspects of his personal affairs, opinions,\nhabits, associations. Indeed, the totality of bank records provides a\nvirtual    current    biography…Development          of...sophisticated\ninstruments have accelerated the ability of the government to\nintrude into areas which a person normally chooses to exclude from\nprying eyes and inquisitive minds. Consequently, judicial\ninterpretations of the constitutional protection of individual privacy\nmust keep pace with the perils created by these new devices.”\nContinuing its trend of expansion of individual rights in the 1960s and 1970s,\nparticularly in the domain of reproductive health - the right to contraceptives as well\nas the right to abortion, the decision in Carey v Population Services International257\n(1977) expanded these rights from adults to also include minors. In this case, a New\nYork law banning sale of even non-prescription contraceptives by persons other than\nlicensed pharmacists; sale or distribution to minors under sixteen; and contraceptive\ndisplay and advertising was declared unconstitutional. Justice Brennan delivered the\nmajority opinion of the Court and held that the Fourteenth Amendment is not for “adults\nalone” and “Minors, as well as adults, are protected by the Constitution”:\n257\n431 US 678 (1977)\n151\nPART K\n“This right of personal privacy includes \"the interest in\nindependence in making certain kinds of important decisions.\" ...\nWhile the outer limits of this aspect of privacy have not been marked\nby the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual\nmay make without unjustified government interference are personal\ndecisions \"relating to marriage...; procreation...; contraception...;\nfamily relationships...; and childrearing and education...”\nIt was further held that:\n“The decision whether or not to beget or bear a child is at the very\nheart of this cluster of constitutionally protected choices... This is\nunderstandable, for in a field that, by definition, concerns the most\nintimate of human activities and relationships, decisions whether to\naccomplish or to prevent conception are among the most private\nand sensitive…”\nThe Court also held that the right to privacy may be limited by a regulation,\nwhich is governed by a sufficient ‘compelling state interest’.\nIn Smith v Maryland258 (1979), it was held that installation and use of a ‘pen register’\nwas not a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and hence no\nwarrant was required. Justice Blackmun delivered the majority (5: 4) opinion and held\nthat the petitioner’s claim that he had a “legitimate expectation of privacy” could not\nbe sustained:\n“First, we doubt that people     in general entertain any actual\nexpectation of privacy in the    numbers they dial. All telephone\nusers realize that they must     \"convey\" phone numbers to the\ntelephone company, since it       is through telephone company\n258\n442 US 735 (1979)\n152\nPART K\nswitching equipment that their calls are completed. All subscribers\nrealize, moreover, that the phone company has facilities for making\npermanent records of the numbers they dial, for they see a list of\ntheir long-distance (toll) calls on their monthly bills. In fact, pen\nregisters and similar devices are routinely used by telephone\ncompanies \"for the purposes of checking billing operations,\ndetecting fraud, and preventing violations of law.\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\nThe majority adopted the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test as formulated by\nJustice Harlan in Katz and held as follows:\n“[The] inquiry, as Mr. Justice Harlan aptly noted in his Katz\nconcurrence, normally embraces two discrete questions. The first\nis whether the individual, by his conduct, has \"exhibited an actual\n(subjective) expectation of privacy\"... whether... the individual has\nshown that \"he seeks to preserve [something] as private\"... The\nsecond question is whether the individual's subjective expectation\nof privacy is \"one that society is prepared to recognize as\nreasonable,'\"... whether... the individual's expectation, viewed\nobjectively, is \"justifiable\" under the circumstances.\nSince the pen register was installed on telephone company\nproperty at the telephone company's central offices, petitioner\nobviously cannot claim that his \"property\" was invaded or that\npolice intruded into a \"constitutionally protected area.\"\nThus the Court held that the petitioner in all probability entertained no actual\nexpectation of privacy in the phone numbers he dialled, and that, even if he did, his\nexpectation was not “legitimate.” However, the judgment also noted the limitations of\nthe Katz test:\n“Situations can be imagined, of course, in which Katz' two-\npronged inquiry would provide an inadequate index of Fourth\nAmendment protection… In such circumstances, where an\nindividual's subjective expectations had been \"conditioned\" by\ninfluences alien to well recognized Fourth Amendment freedoms,\nthose subjective expectations obviously could play no meaningful\n153\nPART K\nrole in ascertaining what the scope of Fourth Amendment protection\nwas. “\nJustice Stewart wrote the dissent, joined by Justice Brennan and held that there was\na legitimate expectation of privacy in this case:\n“...the numbers dialled from a private telephone -- like the\nconversations that occur during a call -- are within the constitutional\nprotection recognized in Katz. It seems clear to me that information\nobtained by pen register surveillance of a private telephone is\ninformation in which the telephone subscriber has a legitimate\nexpectation of privacy. The information captured by such\nsurveillance emanates from private conduct within a person's home\nor office -- locations that without question are entitled to Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendment protection. Further, that information is an\nintegral part of the telephonic communication that, under Katz, is\nentitled to constitutional protection…”\nJustice Marshal dissented and opined on the dangers of permitting such surveillance,\nholding:\n“The use of pen registers, I believe, constitutes such an extensive\nintrusion. To hold otherwise ignores the vital role telephonic\ncommunication plays in our personal and professional\nrelationships, as well as the First and Fourth Amendment interests\nimplicated by unfettered official surveillance. Privacy in placing calls\nis of value not only to those engaged in criminal activity. The\nprospect of unregulated governmental monitoring will undoubtedly\nprove disturbing even to those with nothing illicit to hide. Many\nindividuals, including members of unpopular political organizations\nor journalists with confidential sources, may legitimately wish to\navoid disclosure of their personal contacts...\nPermitting governmental access to telephone records on less\nthan probable cause may thus impede certain forms of political\naffiliation and journalistic endeavor that are the hallmark of a\ntruly free society. Particularly given the Government's previous\nreliance on warrantless telephonic surveillance to trace reporters'\nsources and monitor protected political activity...\n154\nPART K\nI am unwilling to insulate use of pen registers from independent\njudicial review.” (emphasis supplied)\nIn Planned Parenthood v Casey259 (1992), several Pennsylvania state statutory\nprovisions regarding abortion such as spousal consent were challenged. The Court\nreaffirmed- what it called- the “essential holding”260 of Roe v Wade (supra), and\nobserved:\n“...Our precedents “have respected the private realm of family life\nwhich the state cannot enter.” ... These matters, involving the most\nintimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime,\nchoices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the\nliberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of\nliberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of\nmeaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs\nabout these matters could not define the attributes of personhood\nwere they formed under compulsion of the State…\nThe woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the\nmost central principle of Roe v. Wade. It is a rule of law and a\ncomponent of liberty we cannot renounce.”\nIn Minnesota v Carter261 (1998), the question was whether the Fourth Amendment\nprotected against the viewing by an outside police officer, through a drawn window\nblind, of the defendants’ bagging cocaine in an apartment. The Court answered this\nquestion in the negative. Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the majority opinion of the\n259\n505 US 833 (1992)\n260\nThe essential holding of Roe, as summarized in Planned Parenthood, comprised of the following three parts:\n(1) a recognition of a woman's right to choose to have an abortion before foetal viability and to obtain it without\nundue interference from the State, whose pre-viability interests are not strong enough to support an abortion\nprohibition or the imposition of substantial obstacles to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure; (2) a\nconfirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies\nendangering a woman's life or health; and (3) the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset\nof the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.\n261\n525 US 83 (1998)\n155\nPART K\nCourt noting that “[t]he text of the Amendment suggests that its protections extend\nonly to people in “their” houses.” The case was distinguished from Minnesota v\nOlson262 (1990), where the Supreme Court decided that an overnight guest in a house\nhad the sort of expectation of privacy that the Fourth Amendment protects. The Court\nwas of the view that while an overnight guest in a home may claim the protection of\nthe Fourth Amendment, one who is merely present with the consent of the\nhouseholder may not. The respondents, in this case, were not overnight guests, but\nwere present for a business transaction and were only in the home for a few hours.\nThe Court held:\n“Property used for commercial purposes is treated differently\nfor Fourth Amendment purposes from residential property.\n\"An expectation of privacy in commercial premises, however,\nis different from, and indeed less than, a similar expectation in\nan individual's home.\"...\nAnd while it was a \"home\" in which respondents were present, it\nwas not their home…\nthe purely commercial nature of the transaction engaged in here,\nthe relatively short period of time on the premises, and the lack of\nany previous connection between respondents and the\nhouseholder, all lead us to conclude .... any search which may have\noccurred did not violate their Fourth Amendment rights.” (emphasis\nsupplied)\nJustice Ginsburg wrote the dissenting opinion joined by Justice Stevens and Justice\nSouter, and held that:\n“Our decisions indicate that people have a reasonable expectation\nof privacy in their homes in part because they have the prerogative\n262\n495 US 91 (1990)\n156\nPART K\nto exclude others… Through the host’s invitation, the guest gains a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the home. Minnesota v. Olson,\n495 U. S. 91 (1990), so held with respect to an overnight guest. The\nlogic of that decision extends to shorter term guests as well.”\nIn Kyllo v United States263 (2001), the Court held (5:4 majority) that the thermal\nimaging of the house of a person suspected of growing marijuana was a violation of\nthe right to privacy. Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court and held that\nthere is no distinction between “off-the-wall” and “through-the-wall” surveillance as\nboth lead to an intrusion into an individual’s privacy:\n“Limiting the prohibition of thermal imaging to “intimate\ndetails” would not only be wrong in principle; it would be\nimpractical in application, failing to provide “a workable\naccommodation between the needs of law enforcement and\nthe interests protected by the Fourth Amendment,”…\nWe…would have to develop a jurisprudence specifying which home\nactivities are “intimate” and which are not. And even when (if ever)\nthat jurisprudence were fully developed, no police officer would be\nable to know in advance whether his through-the-wall surveillance\npicks up “intimate” details–and thus would be unable to know in\nadvance whether it is constitutional…” (emphasis supplied)\nIt was concluded that even though no “significant” compromise of the homeowner’s\nprivacy had occurred due to the thermal imaging, “the long view, from the original\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment” must be taken forward.\n263\n533 US 27 (2001)\n157\nPART K\nIn Lawrence v Texas264, the Court in a 6:3 decision struck down the sodomy law in\nTexas and by extension invalidated sodomy laws in 13 other states, making same-\nsex sexual activity legal in every state and territory of the United States. The Court\noverturned its previous ruling on the same issue in the 1986 case, Bowers v\nHardwick265 (1986), where it upheld a challenged Georgia statute and did not find a\nconstitutional protection of sexual privacy. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the\nmajority opinion (6: 3 decision) and held that:\n“The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The\nState cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by\nmaking their private sexual conduct a crime… It is a promise of the\nConstitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the\ngovernment may not enter… The Texas statute furthers no\nlegitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the\npersonal and private life of the individual.”\nInformational privacy was the core issue in NASA v Nelson266 (2011). The Court held\nunanimously that NASA’s background checks of contract employees did not violate\nany constitutional privacy right. The employees had argued that their constitutional\nright to privacy as envisaged in previous US Supreme Court judgments namely\nWhalen v Roe267 (1977) and Nixon v Administrator of General Services268 (1977),\n264\n539 US 558 (2003)\n265\n478 US 186 (1986)\n266\n562 US 134 (2011)\n267\n429 US 589 (1977). In this case, for the first time, the Court explicitly recognized an individual’s interest in\nnondisclosure of information. The Court chose to address the status of privacy in the Constitution, underlining\nthat the constitutional right to privacy remains largely undefined and then identified the types of constitutionally\nprotected privacy interests as follows: “The cases sometimes characterized as protecting ‘privacy’ have in fact\ninvolved at least two different kinds of interests. One is the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal\nmatters, and another is the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.”\n268\n433 US 425 (1977). In this case, the former President of US, Nixon, was challenging the Presidential\nRecordings and Material Preservation Act, 1974 on the ground that it violated his right of privacy, as there would\n158\nPART K\nwas violated by background checks. The majority judgment delivered by Justice Alito,\ndecided the case assuming that there existed a constitutional right to privacy. The\nCourt held that:\n“We hold, however, that the challenged portions of the\nGovernment’s background check do not violate this right in the\npresent case. The Government’s interests as employer and\nproprietor in managing its internal operations, combined with the\nprotections against public dissemination provided by the Privacy\nAct of 1974, satisfy any “interest in avoiding disclosure” that may\n“arguably ha[ve] its roots in the Constitution… The Government has\ngood reason to ask employees about their recent illegal-drug use.”\nThe majority also rejected all the contentions regarding the misuse of collected data\nand held:\n“… the mere possibility that security measures will fail provides no\n“proper ground” for a broad-based attack on government\ninformation-collection practices. Ibid. Respondents also cite a\nportion of SF–85 that warns of possible disclosure “[t]o the news\nmedia or the general public.” App. 89. By its terms, this exception\nallows public disclosure only where release is “in the public\ninterest” and would not result in “an unwarranted invasion of\npersonal privacy.” Ibid. Respondents have not cited any\nexample of such a disclosure, nor have they identified any\nplausible scenario in which their information might be unduly\ndisclosed under this exception… In light of the protection\nprovided by the Privacy Act’s nondisclosure requirement, and\nbecause the challenged portions of the forms consist of\nreasonable inquiries in an employment background check, we\nconclude that the Government’s inquiries do not violate a\nconstitutional right to informational privacy.” (emphasis\nsupplied)\nbe intrusion through the screening of his documents. Nixon’s plea was rejected by the Court, which held held\nthat “any intrusion [against privacy] must be weighed against the public interest”.\n159\nPART K\nJustice Scalia, in a concurring opinion joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that the\nbackground checks did not violate any constitutional rights, but argued that the Court\nshould have settled the constitutional privacy question in the negative. The view held\nwas that there exists no constitutional right to informational privacy. Scalia J. criticized\nthe Court's decision to evade the constitutional question, stating that:\n“If, on the other hand, the Court believes that there is a\nconstitutional right to informational privacy, then I fail to see the\nminimalist virtues in delivering a lengthy opinion analyzing that right\nwhile coyly noting that the right is “assumed” rather than\n“decided”… The Court decides that the Government did not\nviolate the right to informational privacy without deciding\nwhether there is a right to informational privacy, and without\neven describing what hypothetical standard should be used to\nassess whether the hypothetical right has been violated.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn United States v Jones269 (2012), it was held unanimously that installing a Global\nPositioning System (GPS) tracking device on a vehicle and using the device to monitor\nthe vehicle's movements constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment.\nHowever, the judges were split 5:4 as to the fundamental reasons behind the\nconclusion. Justice Scalia delivered the majority judgment, applying the trespass test.\nIt was held that the Government’s physical intrusion onto the defendant's car for the\npurpose of obtaining information constituted trespass and therefore a “search”. Justice\n269\n565 US 400 (2012)\n160\nPART K\nScalia, however, left unanswered the question surrounding the privacy implications of\na warrantless use of GPS data without physical intrusion.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, concurred with Justice Scalia, but addressed the privacy\naspects of the judgment. Justice Sotomayor agreed with Justice Alito’s concurrence\nthat “physical intrusion is now unnecessary to many forms of surveillance”, and held\nthat “[i]n cases of electronic or other novel modes of surveillance that do not depend\nupon a physical invasion on property, the majority opinion’s trespassory test may\nprovide little guidance”. It was further observed:\n“GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a\nperson’s public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her\nfamilial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.\nDisclosed in [GPS] data… will be trips the indisputably private\nnature of which takes little imagination to conjure: trips to the\npsychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS\ntreatment center, the strip club, the criminal defense attorney, the\nby-the-hour motel, the union meeting, the mosque, synagogue or\nchurch, the gay bar and on and on… The Government can store\nsuch records and efficiently mine them for information years into the\nfuture… And because GPS monitoring is cheap in comparison to\nconventional surveillance techniques and, by design, proceeds\nsurreptitiously, it evades the ordinary checks that constrain abusive\nlaw enforcement practices: “limited police resources and\ncommunity hostility”…\nThe net result is that GPS monitoring—by making available at\na relatively low cost such a substantial quantum of intimate\ninformation about any person whom the Government, in its\nunfettered discretion, chooses to track—may “alter the\nrelationship between citizen and government in a way that is\ninimical to democratic society”.” (emphasis supplied)\nJustice Sotomayor concluded, by stating:\n161\nPART K\n“[I] doubt that people would accept without complaint the\nwarrantless disclosure to the Government of a list of every Web site\nthey had visited [or phone numbers dialled]... I would not assume\nthat all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the\npublic for a limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to\nFourth Amendment protection.”\nIn Florida v Jardines270 (2013), the Court held that police use of a trained detection\ndog to sniff for narcotics on the front porch of a private home is a “search” within the\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, and therefore, without\nconsent, requires both probable cause and a search warrant. Justice Scalia who\ndelivered the opinion of the Court held as follows:\n“We… regard the area “immediately surrounding and\nassociated with the home”—…..as “part of the home itself for\nFourth Amendment purposes.” ….This area around the home is\n“intimately linked to the home, both physically and\npsychologically,” and is where “privacy expectations are most\nheightened”.” (emphasis supplied)\nJustice Kagan, in a concurring opinion, wrote:\n“Like the binoculars, a drug-detection dog is a specialized device\nfor discovering objects not in plain view (or plain smell). And as in\nthe hypothetical above, that device was aimed here at a home—\nthe most private and inviolate (or so we expect) of all the\nplaces and things the Fourth Amendment protects… the\ndevice is not “in general public use,” training it on a home\nviolates our “minimal expectation of privacy”—an expectation\n“that exists, and that is acknowledged to be reasonable”.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n270\n569 US 1 (2013)\n162\nPART K\nThree years ago, in Riley v California271 (2014), the Court unanimously held that the\nwarrantless search and seizure of digital contents of a cell phone during an arrest is\nunconstitutional. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court and\ncommented on the impact on privacy in an era of cell phones:\n“Before cell phones, a search of a person was limited by\nphysical realities and tended as a general matter to constitute\nonly a narrow intrusion on privacy...the possible intrusion on\nprivacy is not physically limited in the same way when it comes\nto cell phones…Data on a cell phone can also reveal where a\nperson has been. Historic location information is a standard\nfeature on many smart phones and can reconstruct someone’s\nspecific movements down to the minute, not only around town\nbut also within a particular building… Mobile application\nsoftware on a cell phone, or “apps,” offer a range of tools for\nmanaging detailed information about all aspects of a person’s\nlife…\nModern cell phones are not just another technological\nconvenience. With all they contain and all they may reveal,\nthey hold for many Americans “the privacies of life”... The fact\nthat technology now allows an individual to carry such\ninformation in his hand does not make the information any less\nworthy of the protection for which the Founders fought. Our\nanswer to the question of what police must do before searching a\ncell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple— get\na warrant.” (emphasis supplied)\nIn Obergefell v Hodges272, the Court held in a 5:4 decision that the fundamental right\nto marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Kennedy authored\nthe majority opinion (joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotamayor and Kagan):\n271\n573 US __ (2014)\n272\n576 US __ (2015)\n163\nPART K\n“Indeed, the Court has noted it would be contradictory to\nrecognize a right of privacy with respect to other matters of\nfamily life and not with respect to the decision to enter the\nrelationship that is the foundation of the family in our society.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe development of the jurisprudence on the right to privacy in the United States of\nAmerica shows that even though there is no explicit mention of the word ‘privacy’ in\nthe Constitution, the courts of the country have not only recognised the right to privacy\nunder various Amendments of the Constitution but also progressively extended the\nambit of protection under the right to privacy. In its early years, the focus was on\nproperty and protection of physical spaces that would be considered private such as\nan individual’s home. This ‘trespass doctrine’ became irrelevant when it was held that\nwhat is protected under the right to privacy is “people, not places”. The ‘reasonable\nexpectation of privacy’ test has been relied on subsequently by various other\njurisdictions while developing the right to privacy. Having located the right to privacy\nin the ‘person’, American jurisprudence on the right to privacy has developed to shield\nvarious private aspects of a person’s life from interference by the state - such as\nconscience, education, personal information, communications and conversations,\nsexuality, marriage, procreation, contraception, individual beliefs, thoughts and\nemotions, political and other social groups. Various judgments of the Court have also\nanalysed technological developments which have made surveillance more pervasive\nand affecting citizens’ privacy. In all these cases, the Court has tried to balance the\ninterests of the individual in maintaining the right to privacy with the interest of the\nState in maintaining law and order. Decisions of the Supreme Court decriminalizing\n164\nPART K\nconsensual sexual activity between homosexuals and guaranteeing same-sex\ncouples the right to marry indicate that the right to privacy is intrinsic to the\nconstitutional guarantees of liberty and equal protection of laws.\n(iii) Constitutional right to privacy in South Africa\nIn South Africa, the right to privacy has been enshrined in\nSection 14\nof the Bill of\nRights in the 1996 Constitution.\nSection 14\nprovides that:\n“14. Privacy.-Everyone has the right to privacy, which includes the right\nnot to have-\n(a) their person or home searched;\n(6) their property searched;\n(c) their possessions seized; or\n(d) the privacy of their communications infringed.”\nIn National Media Ltd v Jooste273 (1996), Justice Harms defined privacy in the\nfollowing terms:\n“Privacy is an individual condition of life characterised by exclusion\nfrom the public and publicity. The condition embraces all those\npersonal facts which a person concerned has determined him to be\nexcluded from the knowledge of outsiders and in respect of which he\nhas the will that they be kept private”\nOn the ambit of the right to privacy, the Court held that:\n“A right to privacy encompasses the competence to determine the\ndestiny of private facts…\nThe individual concerned is entitled to dictate the ambit of disclosure ...\n273\n1996 (3) SA 262 (A)\n165\nPART K\nthe purpose and method [of] the disclosure... when and under what\nconditions private facts may be made public. A contrary view will place\nundue constraints upon the individual's so-called “absolute rights of\npersonality”…\nIt will also mean that rights of personality are of a lower order than real\nor personal rights”.\nIn\nBernstein v Bester and Others274\n(1996), the South African Supreme Court\ndecided on a challenge to the constitutionality of certain sections of the\nCompanies\nAct\n, on the ground that examination under these sections violated the general right\nto personal privacy (\nsection 13\n). It was held that the provisions were not in breach of\nthe Constitution. Justice Ackermann expounded upon the concept of privacy as\nfollows:\n“The scope of privacy has been closely related to the concept of identity\nand ... [that] the right… [is] based on a notion of the unencumbered\nself, but on the notion of what is necessary to have one’s own\nautonomous identity”.\nThe Court observed that like every other right, the right to privacy also has its limits:\n“[67] In the context of privacy it is only the inner sanctum of a person,\nsuch as his/her family life, sexual preference and home environment,\nwhich is shielded from erosion by conflicting rights of the community.\nThis implies that community rights and the rights of fellow members\nplace a corresponding obligation on a citizen, thereby shaping the\nabstract notion of individualism towards identifying a concrete member\nof civil society. Privacy is acknowledged in the truly personal realm, but\nas a person moves into communal relations and activities such as\nbusiness and social interaction, the scope of personal space shrinks\naccordingly.”\n274\n1996 (2) SA 751 (CC)\n166\nPART K\nThe constitutional validity of laws making sodomy an offence was challenged in\nNational Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice275 (1999).\nIt was held that the common law offence of sodomy was inconsistent with the\nConstitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. Ackermann J. described how\ndiscrimination leads to invasion of privacy and held that:\n“Privacy recognises that we all have a right to a sphere of private\nintimacy and autonomy which allows us to establish and nurture human\nrelationships without interference from the outside community. The way\nin which we give expression to our sexuality is at the core of this area\nof private intimacy. If, in expressing our sexuality, we act consensually\nand without harming one another, invasion of that precinct will be a\nbreach of our privacy…”\nSachs J. discussed the interrelation between equality and privacy and held that:\n“...equality and privacy cannot be separated, because they are both\nviolated simultaneously by anti-sodomy laws. In the present matter,\nsuch laws deny equal respect for difference, which lies at the heart of\nequality, and become the basis for the invasion of privacy. At the same\ntime, the negation by the state of different forms of intimate personal\nbehaviour becomes the foundation for the repudiation of equality.”\nOn the meaning of ‘autonomy’, the Court observed that:\n“Autonomy must mean far more than the right to occupy an\nenvelope of space in which a socially detached individual can act\nfreely from interference by the state. What is crucial is the nature\nof the activity, not its site. While recognising the unique worth of each\nperson, the Constitution does not presuppose that a holder of rights\nis as an isolated, lonely and abstract figure possessing a disembodied\nand socially disconnected self. It acknowledges that people live in\ntheir bodies, their communities, their cultures, their places and\ntheir times. ...It is not for the state to choose or to arrange the choice\n275\n1999 (1) SA 6 (CC)\n167\nPART K\nof partner, but for the partners to choose themselves.” (emphasis\nsupplied)\nJustice Sachs noted that the motif which links and unites equality and privacy, and\nwhich runs right through the protections offered by the Bill of Rights, is dignity.\nIn Investigating Directorate: Serious Offences v Hyundai Motor Distributors\nLtd276 (2001), the Court was concerned with the constitutionality of the provisions of\nthe National Prosecuting Authority Act that authorised the issuing of warrants of\nsearch and seizure for purposes of a “preparatory investigation”.\nLanga J. delivered judgment on the right to privacy of juristic persons and held that:\n“... privacy is a right which becomes more intense the closer it moves\nto the intimate personal sphere of the life of human beings, and less\nintense as it moves away from that core. This understanding of the right\nflows... from the value placed on human dignity by the Constitution.\nJuristic persons are not the bearers of human dignity. Their privacy\nrights, therefore, can never be as intense as those of human beings.\nHowever, this does not mean that juristic persons are not protected by\nthe right to privacy. Exclusion of juristic persons would lead to the\npossibility of grave violations of privacy in our society, with serious\nimplications for the conduct of affairs.”\nHighlighting the need to balance interests of the individual and the State, it was held\nthat:\n“[54] ...Search and seizure provisions, in the context of a preparatory\ninvestigation, serve an important purpose in the fight against crime.\nThat the state has a pressing interest which involves the security and\nfreedom of the community as a whole is beyond question. It is an\nobjective which is sufficiently important to justify the limitation of the\n276\n2001 (1) SA 545 (CC)\n168\nPART K\nright to privacy of an individual in certain circumstances….On the other\nhand, state officials are not entitled without good cause to invade the\npremises of persons for purposes of searching and seizing property;\n...A balance must therefore be struck between the interests of the\nindividual and that of the state, a task that lies at the heart of the\ninquiry into the limitation of rights.” (emphasis supplied)\nIn Minister of Home Affairs and Another v Fourie and Another277 (2006), the\nConstitutional Court of South Africa ruled unanimously that same-sex couples have a\nconstitutional right to marry. The judgment delivered by Justice Sachs, held that:\n“\nSection 9(1)\nof the Constitution provides: “Everyone is equal before\nthe law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law.”...\nSections 9(1)\nand\n9(3)\ncannot be read as merely protecting same-sex\ncouples from punishment or stigmatisation. They also go beyond\nsimply preserving a private space in which gay and lesbian\ncouples may live together without interference from the state.\nIndeed, what the applicants in this matter seek is not the right to\nbe left alone, but the right to be acknowledged as equals and to\nbe embraced with dignity by the law…\nIt is demeaning to adoptive parents to suggest that their family is\nany less a family and any less entitled to respect and concern than\na family with procreated children. It is even demeaning of a couple\nwho voluntarily decide not to have children or sexual relations\nwith one another; this being a decision entirely within their\nprotected sphere of freedom and privacy...” (emphasis supplied)\nIn NM and Others v Smith and Others278 (2007), the names of three women who\nwere HIV positive were disclosed in a biography. They alleged that the publication,\nwithout their prior consent, violated their rights to privacy, dignity and psychological\nintegrity. The Court by majority held that the respondents were aware that the\napplicants had not given their express consent but had published their names, thereby\n277\n2006 (1) SA 524 (CC).\n278\n2007 (5) SA 250 (CC).\n169\nPART K\nviolating their privacy and dignity rights. Justice Madala delivered the majority\njudgment on the basis of the value of privacy and confidentiality in medical information\nand held that:\n“Private and confidential medical information contains highly sensitive\nand personal information about individuals. The personal and intimate\nnature of an individual’s health information, unlike other forms of\ndocumentation, reflects delicate decisions and choices relating to\nissues pertaining to bodily and psychological integrity and personal\nautonomy…\nIndividuals value the privacy of confidential medical information\nbecause of the vast number of people who could have access to the\ninformation and the potential harmful effects that may result from\ndisclosure. The lack of respect for private medical information and its\nsubsequent disclosure may result in fear jeopardising an individual’s\nright to make certain fundamental choices that he/she has a right to\nmake. There is therefore a strong privacy interest in maintaining\nconfidentiality.”\nThe decision of the Court was that there must be a pressing social need for the right\nto privacy to be interfered with and that there was no such compelling public interest\nin this case.\nIn the dissenting opinion, Justice O’Regan held that the publication of the names and\nHIV status of the women was neither intentional nor negligent. In that view, the\nrespondents had assumed that consent was given because the applicants’ names\nand HIV status were published in a publication, with no disclaimer regarding their\nconsent to the contrary. While elaborating on the constitutional right of privacy, the\nCourt held that:\n“... although as human beings we live in a community and are in a\nreal sense both constituted by and constitutive of that community,\n170\nPART K\nwe are nevertheless entitled to a personal sphere from which we\nmay and do exclude that community. In that personal sphere, we\nestablish and foster intimate human relationships and live our daily\nlives. This sphere in which to pursue our own ends and interests in\nour own ways, although often mundane, is intensely important to\nwhat makes human life meaningful.”\nAccording to the decision, there are two inter-related reasons for the constitutional\nprotection of privacy- one flows from the “constitutional conception of what it means\nto be a human being” and the second from the “constitutional conception of the state”:\n“An implicit part of [the first] aspect of privacy is the right to choose\nwhat personal information of ours is released into the public space.\nThe more intimate that information, the more important it is in\nfostering privacy, dignity and autonomy that an individual\nmakes the primary decision whether to release the\ninformation. That decision should not be made by others. This\naspect of the right to privacy must be respected by all of us, not only\nthe state.\n…Secondly, we value privacy as a necessary part of a\ndemocratic society and as a constraint on the power of the\nstate... In authoritarian societies, the state generally does not afford\nsuch protection. People and homes are often routinely searched\nand the possibility of a private space from which the state can be\nexcluded is often denied. The consequence is a denial of liberty and\nhuman dignity. In democratic societies, this is impermissible.”\n(emphasis supplied)\nThe limits of the right to privacy and the need to balance it with other rights emerge\nfrom the following observations:\n“Recognition of legitimate limits on the inviolability of personal\nspace, however, does not mean that the space is not worthy of\nprotection. The Constitution seeks to ensure that rights reinforce\none another in a constructive manner in order to promote human\nrights generally. At times our Constitution recognises that a balance\nhas to be found to provide protection for the different rights.”\n171\nPART K\nOn the inter-relationship between the right to privacy, liberty and dignity, the Court\nobserved that:\n“The right to privacy recognises the importance of protecting the\nsphere of our personal daily lives from the public. In so doing, it\nhighlights the inter-relationship between privacy, liberty and\ndignity as the key constitutional rights which construct our\nunderstanding of what it means to be a human being. All these\nrights are therefore inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing.\nWe value privacy for this reason at least – that the constitutional\nconception of being a human being asserts and seeks to foster the\npossibility of human beings choosing how to live their lives within\nthe overall framework of a broader community.” (emphasis\nsupplied)\nThe interim as well as the Final Constitution of South Africa contain explicit provisions\nguaranteeing the right to privacy. The Judges of South African Supreme Court have\ngiven an expansive meaning to the right, making significant inter-linkages between\nequality, privacy and dignity. In doing so, it has been acknowledged that the right to\nprivacy does not exist in a vacuum, its contravention having a significant bearing on\nother citizen rights as well. Such an interpretation may prove to have a catalytic effect\non a country transitioning from an apartheid state to a democratic nation.\n(iv) Constitutional right to privacy in Canada\nAlthough the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms of 1982 (“the Charter”) does\nnot explicitly provide for a right to privacy, certain sections of the Charter have been\nrelied on by the Supreme Court of Canada to recognize a right to privacy. Most\n172\nPART K\nnotably, Section 8279 (the Canadian version of the Fourth Amendment of the US\nConstitution) has been employed in this respect. Privacy issues have also been\nrecognized in respect of Section 7280 of the Charter. In 1983, the Privacy Act was\nenacted to regulate how federal government collects, uses and discloses personal\ninformation.281 The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act\n(PIPEDA) governs how private sector organisations collect, use and disclose personal\ninformation in the course of commercial activities\nOne of the landmark cases on the right to privacy was Hunter v Southam Inc282\n(1984). This was also the first Supreme Court of Canada decision to consider\nSection\n8\nof the Charter. In this case, the Combines Investigation Act had authorized several\ncivil servants to enter the offices of Southam Inc and examine documents. The\ncompany claimed that this Act violated\nSection 8\nof the Canadian Charter. The Court\nunanimously held that the Combines Investigation Act violated the Charter as it did\nnot provide an appropriate standard for administering warrants.\nDickson J. wrote the opinion of the Court and observed that the Canadian Charter is\na “purposive document” whose purpose is to “guarantee and to protect, within the\nlimits of reason, the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms it enshrines” and to\n279\nSection 8\nof the Charter provides as follows: “Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable\nsearch or seizure.”\n280\nSection 7\nof the Canadian Charter deals with life, liberty and security of person and states that: “Everyone has\nthe right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance\nwith the principles of fundamental justice.”\n281\nIn Lavigne v. Canada (Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages), [2002] 2 SCR 773, the Supreme\nCourt of Canada recognised the Privacy Act as having a \"quasi-constitutional\" status, as it is “closely linked to\nthe values and rights set out in the Constitution”. The Court also stated that the \"The Privacy Act is a reminder\nof the extent to which the protection of privacy is necessary to the preservation of a free and democratic society”.\n282\n[1984] 2 SCR 145\n173\nPART K\nconstrain governmental action inconsistent with those rights and freedoms. The Court\nheld that since\nSection 8\nis an entrenched constitutional provision, it was “not\nvulnerable to encroachment by legislative enactments in the same way as common\nlaw protections.”\nThe Court held that the purpose of\nSection 8\nis to protect an individual's reasonable\nexpectation of privacy but right to privacy must be balanced against the government’s\nduty to enforce the law. It was further held that:\n“The guarantee of security from unreasonable search and seizure only\nprotects a reasonable expectation. This limitation on the right\nguaranteed by\ns. 8\n, whether it is expressed negatively as freedom from\n\"unreasonable\" search and seizure, or positively as an entitlement to a\n\"reasonable\" expectation of privacy, indicates that an assessment must\nbe made as to whether in a particular situation the public's interest in\nbeing left alone by government must give way to the government's\ninterest in intruding on the individual's privacy in order to advance its\ngoals, notably those of law enforcement.”\nIn Her Majesty, The Queen v Brandon Roy Dyment283 (1988), a patient had met\nwith an accident on a highway. A doctor collected a sample of blood from his wound.\nThe blood sample was taken for medical purposes but was given to a police officer.\nAs a result of an analysis carried out by the police officer, the patient was charged\nwith impaired driving. The Court held that the seizing of blood taken for medical\npurposes was a violation of\nSection 8\nof the Charter and that the spirit of the Charter\n“must not be constrained by narrow legalistic classifications based on notions of\nproperty”. It was further held:\n283\n[1988] 2 SCR 417\n174\nPART K\n“[L]egal claims to privacy in this sense were largely confined to the\nhome. But… [t]o protect privacy only in the home ... is to shelter\nwhat has become, in modern society, only a small part of the\nindividual's daily environmental need for privacy...\nPrivacy is at the heart of liberty in a modern state...Grounded in\nman's physical and moral autonomy, privacy is essential for the\nwell-being of the individual. For this reason alone, it is worthy of\nconstitutional protection, but it also has profound significance for\nthe public order. The restraints imposed on government to pry\ninto the lives of the citizen go to the essence of a democratic\nstate.” (emphasis supplied)\nOn the importance of informational privacy, it was held:\n“This notion of privacy derives from the assumption that all\ninformation about a person is in a fundamental way his own, for him\nto communicate or retain for himself as he sees fit...\nIn modern society, especially, retention of information about oneself\nis extremely important. We may, for one reason or another, wish or\nbe compelled to reveal such information, but situations abound\nwhere the reasonable expectations of the individual that the\ninformation shall remain confidential to the persons to whom, and\nrestricted to the purposes for which it is divulged, must be\nprotected.”\nJustice La Forest wrote on the importance of consent and held that “the use of a\nperson's body without his consent to obtain information about him, invades an area of\npersonal privacy essential to the maintenance of his human dignity.”\nThe Court found that the patient had a “well-founded” and “reasonable” expectation\nof privacy that his blood sample, collected by the doctor, would be used for medical\npurposes only and that such expectation “is intended to protect people not things”. It\nwas held that:\n175\nPART K\n“In the present case, however, the respondent may, for some\npurposes perhaps, be deemed to have impliedly consented to a\nsample being taken for medical purposes, but he retained an\nexpectation that his privacy interest in the sample continue past the\ntime of its taking…Under these circumstances, the sample was\nsurrounded by an aura of privacy meriting Charter protection. For\nthe state to take it in violation of a patient's right to privacy\nconstitutes a seizure for the purposes of\ns. 8\n.”\nR v Plant284\n(1993) is a leading decision of the Supreme Court of Canada on the\nprotection of personal information under the Charter. In this case, a police officer, on\nthe basis of information that marijuana was being grown in an area, accessed the\nelectrical utility’s computer system and discovered that a particular house was\nconsuming an extremely high amount of electricity. Two officers then performed a\nwarrantless perimeter search of the property and observed that the basement\nwindows were covered with something opaque and a that a vent had been blocked\nusing a plastic bag. On the basis of this information, the police obtained a warrant to\nsearch the home and discovered over a hundred seedling marijuana plants. The\naccused was charged with cultivation of marijuana and possession for the purpose of\ntrafficking. The issue was whether the warrantless perimeter search of his home and\nthe seizure of electricity consumption records violated his right against unreasonable\nsearch and seizure under\nsection 8\nof the Charter.\n284\n[1993] 3 S.C.R. 281\n176\nPART K\nThe judgment delivered by Justice Sopinka relied on a part of the United States v\nMiller285 decision, that in order to be constitutionally protected the information must\nbe of a “personal and confidential” nature and held that:\n“In fostering the underlying values of dignity, integrity and autonomy, it\nis fitting that\ns. 8\nof the Charter should seek to protect a biographical\ncore of personal information which individuals in a free and democratic\nsociety would wish to maintain and control from dissemination to the\nstate. This would include information which tends to reveal intimate\ndetails of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual.”\nThe Court held that the perimeter search violated the Charter and that the seizure of\nconsumption records was not in violation of\nSection 8\n. This decision was based on\nthe ground that the pattern of electricity consumption revealed as a result of computer\ninvestigations could not be said to reveal intimate details since “electricity\nconsumption reveals very little about the personal lifestyle or private decisions.”\nIn Her Majesty, The Queen v Walter Tessling286 (2004), the Supreme Court of\nCanada held that the use of thermal imaging by the police in the course of an\ninvestigation of a suspect's property did not constitute a violation of the accused's\nright to a reasonable expectation of privacy under\nSection 8\nof the Canadian Charter.\nOn the reasonable expectation of privacy, it was held that the totality of circumstances\nneed to be considered with particular emphasis on both the existence of a subjective\nexpectation of privacy, and the objective reasonableness of the expectation. The\nCourt ruled that the cases of privacy interests (protected by\nS. 8\nof the Canadian\n285\n425 US 435 (1976)\n286\n(2004) SCC 67\n177\nPART K\nCharter) need to be distinguished between personal privacy, territorial privacy and\ninformational privacy.”\nThe Court relied on Justice Sopinka’s understanding of the scope of the protection of\ninformational privacy in\nR v Plant\n(supra) and held that the information generated by\nFLIR imaging did not reveal a “biographical core of personal information” or “intimate\ndetails of [his] lifestyle”, and therefore\nsection 8\nhad not been violated.\nThe decision in R v Spencer287 (2014) was related to informational privacy. In this\ncase, the appellant used an online software to download child pornography onto a\ncomputer and shared it publicly. The police requested subscriber information\nassociated with an IP address from the appellant’s Internet Service Provider and on\nthe basis of it, searched the computer used by him. The Canadian Supreme Court\nunanimously ruled that the request for an IP address infringed the Charter's guarantee\nagainst unreasonable search and seizure. It was held that the appellant had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. In doing so, it assessed whether there is a\n“reasonable expectation of privacy” in the “totality of the circumstances”, which\nincludes “the nature of the privacy interests implicated by the state action” and “factors\nmore directly concerned with the expectation of privacy, both subjectively and\nobjectively viewed, in relation to those interests”. It was further held:\n“...factors that may be considered in assessing the reasonable\nexpectation of privacy can be grouped under four main headings for\nanalytical convenience: (1) the subject matter of the alleged\nsearch; (2) the claimant's interest in the subject matter; (3) the\nclaimant's subjective expectation of privacy in the subject\n287\n(2014) SCC 43\n178\nPART K\nmatter; and (4) whether this subjective expectation of privacy\nwas objectively reasonable, having regard to the totality of the\ncircumstances.” (emphasis supplied)\nThe issue in the case was whether there is a privacy interest in subscriber information\nwith respect to computers used in homes for private purposes. The Court applied a\nbroad approach in understanding the online privacy interests and held that:\n“Privacy is admittedly a \"broad and somewhat evanescent concept\"...\n[T]he Court has described three broad types of privacy interests -\nterritorial, personal, and informational - which, while often overlapping,\nhave proved helpful in identifying the nature of the privacy interest or\ninterests at stake in particular situations…”\nThe Court found that the nature of appellant’s privacy interest in subscriber\ninformation relating to a computer used privately was primarily an informational\none and held:\n“... the identity of a person linked to their use of the Internet must be\nrecognized as giving rise to a privacy interest beyond that inherent in\nthe person’s name, address and telephone number found in the\nsubscriber information.”\nIt then set out three key elements of informational privacy: privacy as secrecy,\nprivacy as control, and privacy as anonymity. It further emphasised on the\nimportance of anonymity in informational privacy, particularly in the age of the\nInternet and held that:\n“... anonymity may, depending on the totality of the circumstances, be\nthe foundation of a privacy interest that engages constitutional\nprotection against unreasonable search and seizure...”\n179\nPART K\nThough the Court stopped short of recognizing an absolute right to anonymity, it held\nthat “anonymous Internet activity engages a high level of informational privacy”. The\nCourt further held that:\n“The disclosure of this information will often amount to the identification\nof a user with intimate or sensitive activities being carried out online,\nusually on the understanding that these activities would be anonymous.\nA request by a police officer that an ISP voluntarily disclose such\ninformation amounts to a search.”\nThe Canadian Supreme Court has used provisions of the Charter to expand the\nscope of the right to privacy, used traditionally to protect individuals from an invasion\nof their property rights, to an individual’s “reasonable expectation of privacy”. The\nright to privacy has been held to be more than just a physical right as it includes the\nprivacy in information about one’s identity. Informational privacy has frequently been\naddressed under\nSection 8\nof the Charter. Canadian privacy jurisprudence has\ndeveloped with the advent of technology and the internet. Judicial decisions have\nsignificant implications for internet/digital privacy.\n(v) Privacy under The European Convention on Human Rights and the European Charter\nIn Europe, there are two distinct but related frameworks to ensure the protection of\nthe right of privacy. The first is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR),\nan international agreement to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in\nEurope. The second is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\n(CFREU), a treaty enshrining certain political, social, and economic rights for the\n180\nPART K\nEuropean Union. Under ECHR (“the Convention”), the European Court of Human\nRights (ECtHR), also known as the ‘Strasbourg Court’, is the adjudicating body, which\nhears complaints by individuals on alleged breaches of human rights by signatory\nstates. Similarly, under CFREU (“the Charter), the Court of Justice of the European\nUnion (CJEU), also called the ‘Luxembourg Court’, is the chief judicial authority of the\nEuropean Union and oversees the uniform application and interpretation of European\nUnion law, in co-operation with the national judiciary of the member states.\nArticle 8\nof the ECHR provides that:\n“Right to respect for private and family life\n1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his\nhome and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise\nof this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is\nnecessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security,\npublic safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the\nprevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,\nor for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\nUnder the Charter, the relevant provisions are:\nArticle 7\nRespect for private and family life\nEveryone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life,\nhome and communications.\nArticle 8\nProtection of personal data\n1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning\nhim or her.\n181\nPART K\n2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on\nthe basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other\nlegitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to\ndata which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to\nhave it rectified.\n3. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an\nindependent authority.\nArticle 52\nScope of guaranteed rights\n1. Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised\nby this Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of\nthose rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality,\nlimitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet\nobjectives of general interests recognised by the Union of the need to\nprotect the rights and freedoms of others.\n2. Rights recognised by this Charter which are based on the\nCommunity Treaties or the Treaty on European Union shall be\nexercised under the conditions and within the limits defined by those\nTreaties.\n3. In so far as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights\nguaranteed by the Convention of the Protection of Human Rights and\nFundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall\nbe the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision\nshall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection.\nArticle 52(3)\nprovides for the ECHR as a minimum standard of human rights in the\nEU.\nArticle 52(3)\nthus leads the EU to be indirectly bound by the ECHR as it must\nalways be obeyed when restricting fundamental rights in the EU. Moreover, in the pre-\nCharter era, the protection of privacy was held to form part of the right to privacy in\nline with how the ECtHR in Strasbourg interprets\nArt. 8\nof ECHR till date288.\n288\nIn the case of J McB v LE, Case C-400/10 PPU, [2010] ECR I-nyr, the CJEU ruled that where Charter rights\nparalleled ECHR rights, the Court of Justice should follow any consistent jurisprudence of the European Court of\nHuman Rights, elucidating that: “It is clear that the said\nArticle 7 [\nof the EU Charter] contains rights corresponding\nto those guaranteed by\nArticle 8(1)\nof the ECHR.\nArticle 7\nof the Charter must therefore be given the same\nmeaning and the same scope as\nArticle 8(1)\nof the ECHR...” Reference can be passed to a case before ECtHR,\n182\nPART K\nThus, in order to understand the protection extended to the right to privacy in EU, the\njurisprudence of\nArticle 8\nof the Convention and\nArticle 7\nof the Charter need to be\nanalyzed. The term ‘private life’ is an essential ingredient of both these provisions and\nhas been interpreted to encompass a wide range of interests.\nIn the case of Niemietz v Germany289 (1992), the ECtHR observed that:\n“The Court does not consider it possible or necessary to attempt an\nexhaustive definition of the notion of \"private life\". However, it would be\ntoo restrictive to limit the notion to an \"inner circle\" in which the\nindividual may live his own personal life as he chooses and to exclude\ntherefrom entirely the outside world not encompassed within that circle.\nRespect for private life must also comprise to a certain degree the right\nto establish and develop relationships with other human beings.”\nSimilarly, in Costello-Roberts v United Kingdom290 (1993), the ECtHR stated that\n“the notion of \"private life\" is a broad one” and “is not susceptible to exhaustive\ndefinition”.\nThis broad approach is also present in the recent cases of European jurisprudence.\nIn S and Marper v United Kingdom291 (2008), the ECtHR held, with respect to right\nto respect for private life, that :\n“...the concept of “private life”... covers the physical and psychological\nintegrity of a person... It can therefore embrace multiple aspects of the\nperson's physical and social identity... Elements such as, for example,\ngender identification, name and sexual orientation and sexual life fall\nwithin the personal sphere protected by\nArticle 8...\nBeyond a person's\nVarec SA v. État belge, Case C-450/06, [2008] ECR I-581, where it was observed that that: “...the right to respect\nfor private life, enshrined in\nArticle 8\nof the ECHR, which flows from the common constitutional traditions of the\nMember States.... is restated in\nArticle 7\nof the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union”.\n289\nApplication no. 13710/88, judgment dated 16 September 1992.\n290\nApplication no. 13134/87, judgment dated 25 March 1993.\n291\n[2008] ECHR 1581\n183\nPART K\nname, his or her private and family life may include other means of\npersonal identification and of linking to a family... Information about the\nperson's health is an important element of private life... The Court\nfurthermore considers that an individual's ethnic identity must be\nregarded as another such element... The concept of private life\nmoreover includes elements relating to a person's right to their\nimage…”\nIn Uzun v Germany292 (2010), the European Court of Human Rights while examining\nan application claiming violation of\nArticle 8\nobserved that:\n“Article 8 protects, inter alia, a right to identity and personal\ndevelopment, and the right to establish and develop relationships with\nother human beings and the outside world. There is, therefore, a zone\nof interaction of a person with others, even in a public context, which\nmay fall within the scope of “private life”...\nThere are a number of elements relevant to a consideration of whether\na person's private life is concerned by measures effected outside a\nperson's home or private premises. Since there are occasions when\npeople knowingly or intentionally involve themselves in activities which\nare or may be recorded or reported in a public manner, a person's\nreasonable expectations as to privacy may be a significant, although\nnot necessarily conclusive, factor…”\nThus, the determination of a complaint by an individual under\nArticle 8\nof the Convention\nnecessarily involves a two-stage test293, which can be summarized as below:\n“Stage 1:\nArticle 8\npara. 1\n1.1 Does the complaint fall within the scope of one of the rights\nprotected by\nArticle 8\npara 1?\n1.2 If so, is there a positive obligation on the State to respect an\nindividual’s right and has it been fulfilled?\nStage 2:\nArticle 8\npara. 2\n2.1 Has there been an interference with the\nArticle 8\nright?\n2.2 If so,\n292\nApplication No. 35623/05\nUrsula Kilkelly, “The right to respect for private and family life: A guide to the implementation of\nArticle 8\nof the\n293\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights”, Council of Europe (2001), at page 9\n184\nPART K\n2.2.1 is it in accordance with law?\n2.2.2 does it pursue a legitimate aim?\n2.2.3 is it necessary in a democratic society?\nThis test is followed by the Court each time it applies\nArticle 8\nin a\ngiven case.”\nIn other words, a fair balance is struck between the general interest of the community\nand the interests of the individual.\nThe Grand Chamber of 18 judges at the ECtHR, in S and Marper v United Kingdom\n(supra), examined the claim of the applicants that their Right to Respect for Private\nLife under\nArticle 8\nwas being violated as their fingerprints, cell samples and DNA\nprofiles were retained in a database after successful termination of criminal\nproceedings against them. The Court held that there had been a violation of\nArticle 8\nof the Convention. Finding that the retention at issue had constituted a\ndisproportionate interference with the applicants’ right to respect for private life, the\nCourt held that “the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the powers of retention of the\nfingerprints, cellular samples and DNA profiles of persons...fails to strike a fair balance\nbetween the competing public and private interests and that the respondent State has\noverstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation”. It was further held that:\n“The mere storing of data relating to the private life of an individual\namounts to an interference within the meaning of\nArticle 8.\nHowever,\nin determining whether the personal information retained by the\nauthorities involves any of the private-life aspects mentioned above,\nthe Court will have due regard to the specific context in which the\ninformation at issue has been recorded and retained, the nature of the\nrecords, the way in which these records are used and processed and\nthe results that may be obtained.”\n185\nPART K\nApplying the above principles, it was held that:\n“The Court notes at the outset that all three categories of the personal\ninformation retained by the authorities in the present cases, namely\nfingerprints, DNA profiles and cellular samples, constitute personal\ndata within the meaning of the Data Protection Convention as they\nrelate to identified or identifiable individuals. The Government accepted\nthat all three categories are “personal data” within the meaning of the\nData Protection Act 1998 in the hands of those who are able to identify\nthe individual.”\nRegarding the retention of cellular samples and DNA profiles, it was held that:\n“Given the nature and the amount of personal information contained in\ncellular samples, their retention per se must be regarded as interfering\nwith the right to respect for the private lives of the individuals\nconcerned. That only a limited part of this information is actually\nextracted or used by the authorities through DNA profiling and that no\nimmediate detriment is caused in a particular case does not change\nthis conclusion… [T]he DNA profiles' capacity to provide a means of\nidentifying genetic relationships between individuals… is in itself\nsufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the\nprivate life of the individuals concerned... The possibility the DNA\nprofiles create for inferences to be drawn as to ethnic origin makes their\nretention all the more sensitive and susceptible of affecting the right to\nprivate life.”\nRegarding retention of fingerprints, it was held that:\n“...fingerprints objectively contain unique information about the\nindividual concerned allowing his or her identification with precision in\na wide range of circumstances. They are thus capable of affecting his\nor her private life and retention of this information without the consent\nof the individual concerned cannot be regarded as neutral or\ninsignificant…”\nIn Uzun v Germany (supra), the ECtHR examined an application claiming violation of\nArticle 8\nof European Convention of Human Rights where the applicant’s data was\n186\nPART K\nobtained via the Global Positioning System (GPS) by the investigation agencies and\nwas used against him in a criminal proceeding. In this case, the applicant was\nsuspected of involvement in bomb attacks by the left-wing extremist movement. The\nCourt unanimously concluded that there had been no violation of\nArticle 8\nand held\nas follows:\n“GPS surveillance of Mr Uzun had been ordered to investigate several\ncounts of attempted murder for which a terrorist movement had claimed\nresponsibility and to prevent further bomb attacks. It therefore served\nthe interests of national security and public safety, the prevention of\ncrime and the protection of the rights of the victims. It had only been\nordered after less intrusive methods of investigation had proved\ninsufficient, for a relatively short period of time – three months – and it\nhad affected Mr Uzun only when he was travelling with his accomplice’s\ncar. Therefore, he could not be said to have been subjected to total and\ncomprehensive surveillance. Given that the investigation concerned\nvery serious crimes, the Court found that the GPS surveillance of Mr\nUzun had been proportionate.”\nThe decision of the CJEU in the case Asociación Nacional de Establecimientos\nFinancieros de Crédito (ASNEF) v Spain294 relied upon the\nArticle 7\nright to respect\nfor private life and\nArticle 8(1)\nof the Charter to find that the implementation in Spain\nof the Data Protection Directive was defective in that it applied only to information kept\nin a specified public data bank rather than more generally to public and private\ndatabases, on the basis that “the processing of data appearing in non-public sources\nnecessarily implies that information relating to the data subject’s private life will\nthereafter be known by the data controller and, as the case may be, by the third party\nor parties to whom the data is disclosed. This more serious infringement of the data\n294\nC-468/10, 24 November, [2011] ECR I-nyr\n187\nPART K\nsubject’s rights enshrined in\nArticles 7\nand\n8\nof the Charter must be properly taken\ninto account”.\nIn Digital Rights Ireland Ltd v Minister295 (2014), the CJEU examined the validity of\na Data Protection Directive, which required telephone and internet service providers\nto retain details of internet and call data for 6 to 24 months, as well as related data\nnecessary to identify the subscriber or user, so as to ensure that the data is available\nfor the purpose of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of serious\ncrimes. The Court ruled that the Directive is incompatible with\nArticle 52(1)\nof the\nCharter, because the limitations which the said Directive placed were “not\naccompanied by the necessary principles for governing the guarantees needed to\nregulate access to the data and their use”. It was held that:\n“To establish the existence of an interference with the fundamental\nright to privacy, it does not matter whether the information on the private\nlives concerned is sensitive or whether the persons concerned have\nbeen inconvenienced in any way.”\nWhile stating that data relating to the use of electronic communications is particularly\nimportant and therefore a valuable tool in the prevention of offences and the fight\nagainst crime, in particular organised crime, the Court looked into the proportionality\nof the interference with the right to privacy and held that:\n“As regards the necessity for the retention of data required by Directive\n2006/24, it must be held that the fight against serious crime, in\nparticular against organised crime and terrorism, is indeed of the\nutmost importance in order to ensure public security and its\n295\nC-293/12\n188\nPART K\neffectiveness may depend to a great extent on the use of modern\ninvestigation techniques. However, such an objective of general\ninterest, however fundamental it may be, does not, in itself, justify a\nretention measure such as that established by Directive 2006/24 being\nconsidered to be necessary for the purpose of that fight...”\nHighlighting that the said Directive does not provide for sufficient safeguards, it was\nheld that by adopting the Directive, the EU “exceeded the limits imposed by\ncompliance with the principle of proportionality in the light of\nArticles 7\n, 8\nand\n52(1)\nof\nthe Charter.”\nIn RE v The United Kingdom296 (2015), the applicant was arrested and detained on\nthree occasions in relation to the murder of a police officer. He claimed violation of\nArticle 8\nunder the regime of covert surveillance of consultations between detainees\nand their lawyers, medical advisors and appropriate adults297 sanctioned by the\nexisting law. The ECtHR held that:\n“The Court…considers that the surveillance of a legal consultation\nconstitutes an extremely high degree of intrusion into a person’s right\nto respect for his or her private life and correspondence...\nConsequently, in such cases it will expect the same safeguards to be\nin place to protect individuals from arbitrary interference with their\nArticle 8\nrights...\nSurveillance of “appropriate adult”-detainee consultations were not\nsubject to legal privilege and therefore a detainee would not have the\nsame expectation of privacy.…The relevant domestic provisions,\ninsofar as they related to the possible surveillance of consultations\nbetween detainees and “appropriate adults”, were accompanied by\n“adequate safeguards against abuse”, notably as concerned the\nauthorisation, review and record keeping. Hence, there is no violation\nof Article 8.”\n296\nApplication No. 62498/11\n297\nAs per the facts of the case, an “appropriate adults” could be a relative or guardian, or a person experienced\nin dealing with mentally disordered or mentally vulnerable people.\n189\nPART K\nIn Roman Zakharov v Russia298 (2015), ECtHR examined an application claiming\nviolation of\nArticle 8\nof the Convention alleging that the mobile operators had permitted\nunrestricted interception of all telephone communications by the security services\nwithout prior judicial authorisation, under the prevailing national law. The Court\nobserved that:\n“Mr Zakharov was entitled to claim to be a victim of a violation of the\nEuropean Convention, even though he was unable to allege that he\nhad been the subject of a concrete measure of surveillance. Given the\nsecret nature of the surveillance measures provided for by the\nlegislation, their broad scope (affecting all users of mobile telephone\ncommunications) and the lack of effective means to challenge them at\nnational level… Russian law did not meet the “quality of law”\nrequirement and was incapable of keeping the interception of\ncommunications to what was “necessary in a democratic society”.\nThere had accordingly been a violation of\nArticle 8\nof the Convention.”\nBoth the ECtHR and the CJEU, while dealing with the application and interpretation\nof\nArticle 8\nof ECHR and\nArticle 7\nof the Charter, have kept a balanced approached\nbetween individual interests and societal interests. The two-step test in examining an\nindividual claim related to a Convention right has strictly been followed by ECtHR.\n(vi) Decisions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights\nArticle 11\nof the American Convention on Human Rights deals with the Right to\nPrivacy. The provision is extracted below:\n“1. Everyone has the right to have his honor respected and his dignity\nrecognized.\n298\nApplication No. 47143/06\n190\nPART K\n2. No one may be the object of arbitrary or abusive interference with his\nprivate life, his family, his home, or his correspondence, or of unlawful\nattacks on his honor or reputation.\n3. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such\ninterference or attacks.”\nThe decision in Artavia Murillo ET AL. (“In Vitro Fertilization”) v Costa Rica299\n(2012), addressed the question of whether the State’s prohibition on the practice of in\nvitro fertilisation constituted an arbitrary interference with the right to private life. The\nCourt held that:\n“The scope of the protection of the right to private life has been\ninterpreted in broad terms by the international human rights\ncourts, when indicating that this goes beyond the right to privacy.\nThe protection of private life encompasses a series of factors\nassociated with the dignity of the individual, including, for\nexample, the ability to develop his or her own personality and\naspirations, to determine his or her own identity and to define\nhis or her own personal relationships. The concept of private\nlife encompasses aspects of physical and social identity,\nincluding the right to personal autonomy, personal\ndevelopment and the right to establish and develop\nrelationships with other human beings and with the outside\nworld. The effective exercise of the right to private life is\ndecisive for the possibility of exercising personal autonomy on\nthe future course of relevant events for a person’s quality of\nlife. Private life includes the way in which individual views\nhimself and how he decides to project this view towards\nothers, and is an essential condition for the free development\nof the personality… Furthermore, the Court has indicated that\nmotherhood is an essential part of the free development of a\nwoman’s personality. Based on the foregoing, the Court considers\nthat the decision of whether or not to become a parent is part of the\nright to private life and includes, in this case, the decision of whether\nor not to become a mother or father in the genetic or biological\nsense.” (emphasis supplied)\n299\nInter-Am. Ct. H.R. (Ser. C) No. 257\n191\nPART K\nIn Escher et al v Brazil300 (2009), telephonic interception and monitoring of telephonic\nlines was carried out by the military police of the State between April and June 1999.\nThe Court found that the State violated the American Convention on Human Rights\nand held that:\n“Article 11 applies to telephone conversations irrespective of their\ncontent and can even include both the technical operations\ndesigned to record this content by taping it and listening to it, or any\nother element of the communication process; for example, the\ndestination or origin of the calls that are made, the identity of the\nspeakers, the frequency, time and duration of the calls, aspects that\ncan be verified without the need to record the content of the call by\ntaping the conversation…\nArticle 11\nof the Convention recognizes that every person has the\nright to respect for his honor, prohibits an illegal attack against honor\nand reputation, and imposes on the States the obligation to provide\nlegal protection against such attacks. In general, the right to honor\nrelates to self-esteem and self-worth, while reputation refers to the\nopinion that others have of a person…\n[O]wing to the inherent danger of abuse in any monitoring system,\nthis measure must be based on especially precise legislation with\nclear, detailed rules. The American Convention protects the\nconfidentiality and inviolability of communications from any kind of\narbitrary or abusive interference from the State or individuals;\nconsequently, the surveillance, intervention, recording and\ndissemination of such communications is prohibited, except in the\ncases established by law that are adapted to the objects and\npurposes of the American Convention.”\nLike other international jurisdictions, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights dealt\nwith the concept of privacy and private life in broad terms which enhance the value\nof liberty and freedom.\n300\nInter-Am. Ct. H.R. (Ser. C) No. 200\n192\nPART L\nThe development of the law on privacy in these jurisdictions has drawn sustenance from\nthe importance and sanctity attributed to individual freedom and liberty. Constitutions\nwhich, like the Indian Constitution, contain entrenched rights place the dignity of the\nindividual on a high pedestal. Despite cultural differences and disparate histories, a\nstudy of comparative law provides reassurance that the path which we have charted\naccords with a uniform respect for human values in the constitutional culture of the\njurisdictions which we have analysed. These values are universal and of enduring\ncharacter.\nL       Criticisms of the privacy doctrine\n135     The Attorney General for India, leading the arguments before this Court on\nbehalf of Union of India, has been critical of the recognition being given to a general\nright of privacy. The submission has several facets, among them being:\n(i)     there is no general or fundamental right to privacy under the Constitution;\n(ii)    no blanket right to privacy can be read as part of the fundamental rights and\nwhere some of the constituent facets of privacy are already covered by the\nenumerated guarantees in Part III, those facets will be protected in any case;\n(iii)   where specific species of privacy are governed by the protection of liberty in\nPart III of the Constitution, they are subject to reasonable restrictions in the\npublic interest as recognized in several decisions of this Court ;\n193\nPART L\n(iv)   privacy is a concept which does not have any specific meaning or definition\nand the expression is inchoate; and\n(v)    the draftsmen of the Constitution specifically did not include such a right as\npart of the chapter on fundamental rights and even the ambit of the expression\nliberty which was originally sought to be used in the draft Constitution was\npruned to personal liberty. These submissions have been buttressed by Mr\nAryama Sundaram, learned senior counsel.\n136    Criticism and critique lie at the core of democratic governance. Tolerance of\ndissent is equally a cherished value. In deciding a case of such significant dimensions,\nthe Court must factor in the criticisms voiced both domestically and internationally.\nThese, as we notice, are based on academic, philosophical and practical\nconsiderations.\n137    The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy adverts to “several sceptical and\ncritical accounts of privacy”. The criticism is set out thus:\n“There are several sceptical and critical accounts of privacy.\nAccording to one well known argument there is no right to privacy\nand there is nothing special about privacy, because any interest\nprotected as private can be equally well explained and protected by\nother interests or rights, most notably rights to property and bodily\nsecurity (Thomson, 1975). Other critiques argue that privacy\ninterests are not distinctive because the personal interests they\nprotect are economically inefficient (Posner, 1981) or that they are\nnot grounded in any adequate legal doctrine (Bork, 1990). Finally,\nthere is the feminist critique of privacy, that granting special status\n194\nPART L\nto privacy is detrimental to women and others because it is used as\na shield to dominate and control them, silence them, and cover up\nabuse (MacKinnon, 1989).”301\n138     In a 2013 article published in the Harvard Law Review, a professor of law at\nGeorgetown Law Center, Georgetown University, described privacy as having an\n“image problem”302. Privacy, as she notes, has been cast as “old-fashioned at best\nand downright harmful at worst - anti-progressive, overly costly, and inimical to the\nwelfare of the body politic”303. The consequences in her view are predictable:\n“…when privacy and its purportedly outdated values must be\nbalanced against the cutting-edge imperatives of national security,\nefficiency, and entrepreneurship, privacy comes up the loser. The\nlist of privacy counterweights is long and growing. The recent\nadditions of social media, mobile platforms, cloud computing, data\nmining, and predictive analytics now threaten to tip the scales\nentirely, placing privacy in permanent opposition to the progress of\nknowledge.”304\nThe article proceeds to explain that the perception of privacy as antiquated and\nsocially retrograde is wrong. Nonetheless, this criticism has relevance to India. The\nnation aspires to move to a knowledge based economy. Information is the basis of\nknowledge. The scales must, according to this critique, tip in favour of the paramount\nnational need for knowledge, innovation and development. These concerns cannot\nbe discarded and must be factored in. They are based on the need to provide\neconomic growth and social welfare to large swathes of an impoverished society.\n301\n“Privacy” , Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (2002) , available at\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/\n302\nJulie E Cohen, “What Privacy Is For”, Harvard Law Review (2013), Vol. 126, at page 1904\n303\nIbid\n304\nIbid, at pages 1904-1905.\n195\nPART L\n139      Another criticism, which is by Robert Bork, questions the choice of\nfundamental values of the Constitution by judges of the US Supreme Court and the\ntheory (propounded by Justice Douglas in Griswold) of the existence of ‘penumbras’\nor zones of privacy created by the Bill of Rights as a leap of judicial interpretation.305\n140     The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy seeks to offer an understanding\nof the literature on privacy in terms of two concepts: reductionism and coherentism.306\nReductionists are generally critical of privacy while the Coherentists defend\nfundamental values of privacy interests. The criticisms of privacy have been broadly\nsummarised as consisting of the following :\na       Thomson’s Reductionism307\nJudith Jarvis Thomson, in an article published in 1975, noted that while there is little\nagreement on the content of privacy, ultimately privacy is a cluster of rights which\noverlap with property rights or the right to bodily security. In her view, the right to\nprivacy is derivative in the sense that a privacy violation is better understood as\nviolation of a more basic right.\n305\nFor this criticism, see : Robert H Bork, “Neutral Principles and some First Amendment Problems”, Indiana\nLaw Journal (Fall 1971), Vol. 47(1), at pages 8-9\n306\nSupra note 301\n307\nJudith Jarvis Thomson, “The Right to Privacy” , Philosophy and Public Affairs (1975), Vol. 4, at pages 295-\n314, as cited in Supra note 301\n196\nPART L\nb         Posner’s Economic critique308\nRichard Posner, in ‘the Economics of Justice’ published in 1981, argued that\nprivacy is protected in ways that are economically inefficient. In his view, privacy\nshould be protected only when access to information would reduce its value such as\nwhen a student is allowed access to a letter of recommendation for admission,\nrendering such a letter less reliable. According to Posner, privacy when manifested\nas control over information about oneself, is utilised to mislead or manipulate others.\nc         Bork’s critique\nRobert Bork, in ‘The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law’309,\nhas been severe in his criticism of the protection of privacy by the US Supreme Court.\nIn his view, Justice Douglas in Griswold did not derive privacy from some pre-existing\nright but sought to create a new right which has no foundation in the Bill of Rights,\nthereby overstepping the bounds of a judge by making new law and not by interpreting\nit.\nMany theorists urge that the constitutional right to privacy is more correctly regarded\nas a right to liberty.\nThe powerful counter argument to these criticisms is that while individuals possess\nmultiple liberties under the Constitution, read in isolation, many of them are not related\nto the kinds of concerns that emerge in privacy issues. In this view, liberty is a concept\n308\nRichard Posner, The Economics of Justice, Harvard University Press (1981), as cited in Supra note 301\n309\nRobert Bork, The Tempting of America : The Political Seduction of the Law, Simon and Schuster (1990), as\ncited in Supra note 301\n197\nPART L\nwhich is broader than privacy and issues or claims relating to privacy are a sub-set of\nclaims to liberty.310 Hence it has been argued that privacy protects liberty and that\n“privacy protection gains for us the freedom to define ourselves and our relations to\nothers”311. This rationale understands the relationship between liberty and privacy by\nstipulating that while liberty is a broader notion, privacy is essential for protecting\nliberty. Recognizing a constitutional right to privacy is a reaffirmation of the individual\ninterest in making certain decisions crucial to one’s personality and being.\nd       Feminist critique\nMany writers on feminism express concern over the use of privacy as a veneer for\npatriarchal domination and abuse of women. Patriarchal notions still prevail in several\nsocieties including our own and are used as a shield to violate core constitutional\nrights of women based on gender and autonomy. As a result, gender violence is often\ntreated as a matter of “family honour” resulting in the victim of violence suffering twice\nover – the physical and mental trauma of her dignity being violated and the perception\nthat it has cause an affront to “honour”. Privacy must not be utilised as a cover to\nconceal and assert patriarchal mindsets.\nCatherine MacKinnon in a 1989 publication titled ‘Towards a Feminist Theory of\nthe State’312 adverts to the dangers of privacy when it is used to cover up physical\nharm done to women by perpetrating their subjection. Yet, it must also be noticed\n310\nSupra note 301\n311\nIbid\n312\nCatherine MacKinnon, Toward a Feminist Theory of the State, Harvard University Press (1989), as cited in\nSupra note 301\n198\nPART L\nthat women have an inviolable interest in privacy. Privacy is the ultimate guarantee\nagainst violations caused by programmes not unknown to history, such as state\nimposed sterilization programmes or mandatory state imposed drug testing for\nwomen. The challenge in this area is to enable the state to take the violation of the\ndignity of women in the domestic sphere seriously while at the same time protecting\nthe privacy entitlements of women grounded in the identity of gender and liberty.\n141     The submission that privacy has no accepted or defined connotation can be\nanalysed with reference to the evolution of the concept in the literature on the subject.\nSome of the leading approaches which should be considered for an insight into the\nambit and content of privacy:\n(i)     Alan Westin313 defined four basic states of privacy which reflect on the nature\nand extent of the involvement of the individual in the public sphere. At the core is\nsolitude – the most complete state of privacy involving the individual in an “inner\ndialogue with the mind and conscience”.314 The second state is the state of intimacy\nwhich refers not merely to intimate relations between spouses or partners but also\nbetween family, friends and colleagues. The third state is of anonymity where an\nindividual seeks freedom from identification despite being in a public space. The\nfourth state is described as a state of reservation which is expressed as “the need to\n313\nWestin’s categorization of privacy is based on the specific values which it sub-serves. Westin has drawn\nsupport from the distinction made in 1960 by William L. Prosser for the purposes of civil privacy violations or\ntorts, Westin adopted a value based approach, unlike the harms based approach of Prosser. For Prosser’s\nwork, see William L. Prosser, “Privacy”, California Law Review (1960), Vol. 48(3), pages 383-423.\n314\nBert-Jaap Koops et al., “A Typology of Privacy”, University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law (2017),\nVol. 38, Issue 2, at page 496\n199\nPART L\nhold some aspects of ourselves back from others, either as too personal and sacred\nor as too shameful and profane to express”315.\n(ii)     Roger Clarke has developed a classification of privacy on Maslow’s pyramid\nof values316. The values described in Maslow’s pyramid are: self-actualization, self-\nesteem, love or belonging, safety and physiological or biological need. Clarke’s\ncategories include (a) privacy of the person also known as bodily privacy. Bodily\nprivacy is violated by compulsory extraction of samples of body fluids and body tissue\nand compulsory sterilization; (b) privacy of personal behaviour which is part of a\nprivate space including the home; (c) Privacy of personal communications which is\nexpressed as the freedom of communication without interception or routine monitoring\nof one’s communication by others; (d) Privacy of personal data which is linked to the\nconcept of informational privacy.\n(iii)    Anita Allen has, in a 2011 publication, developed the concept of “unpopular\nprivacy”317. According to her, governments must design “unpopular” privacy laws and\nduties to protect the common good, even if privacy is being forced on individuals who\nmay not want it. Individuals under this approach are not permitted to waive their\nprivacy rights. Among the component elements which she notices are : (a) physical\nor spatial privacy – illustrated by the privacy in the home; (b) informational privacy\nincluding information data or facts about persons or their communications; (c)\n315\nIbid, at page 497\n316\nIbid, at 498\n317\nIbid, at 500\n200\nPART L\ndecisional privacy which protects the right of citizens to make intimate choices about\ntheir rights from intrusion by the State; (d) proprietary privacy which relates to the\nprotection of one’s reputation; (e) associational privacy which protects the right of\ngroups with certain defined characteristics to determine whom they may include or\nexclude.318\nPrivacy has distinct connotations including (i) spatial control; (ii) decisional autonomy;\nand (iii) informational control.319 Spatial control denotes the creation of private spaces.\nDecisional autonomy comprehends intimate personal choices such as those\ngoverning reproduction as well as choices expressed in public such as faith or modes\nof dress. Informational control empowers the individual to use privacy as a shield to\nretain personal control over information pertaining to the person. With regard to\ninformational privacy, it has been stated that :\n“…perhaps the most convincing conception is proposed by Helen\nNissenbaum who argues that privacy is the expectation that\ninformation about a person will be treated appropriately. This\ntheory of “contextual integrity” believes people do not want to\ncontrol their information or become inaccessible as much as they\nwant their information to be treated in accordance with their\nexpectation (Nissenbaum 2004, 2010, 2011).”320\nIntegrated together, the fundamental notions of privacy have been depicted in a\nseminal article published in 2017 titled “A Typology of privacy”321 in the University\n318\nIbid, at pages 500-501\n319\nBhairav Acharya, “The Four Parts of Privacy in India”, Economic & Political Weekly (2015), Vol. 50 Issue 22,\nat page 32\n320\nIbid, at page 34\n321\nBert-Jaap Koops et al., “A Typology of Privacy”, University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law (2017),\nVol. 38 Issue 2, at page 566\n201\nPART L\nof Pennsylvania Journal of International Law.

The nine primary types of privacy are, according to the above\ndepiction: (i) bodily privacy which reflects the privacy of the physical body. Implicit in\nthis is the negative freedom of being able to prevent others from violating one’s body\nor from restraining the freedom of bodily movement; (ii) spatial privacy which is\nreflected in the privacy of a private space through which access of others can be\nrestricted to the space; intimate relations and family life are an apt illustration of spatial\nprivacy; (iii) communicational privacy which is reflected in enabling an individual to\n202\nPART M\nrestrict access to communications or control the use of information which is\ncommunicated to third parties; (iv) proprietary privacy which is reflected by the interest\nof a person in utilising property as a means to shield facts, things or information from\nothers; (v) intellectual privacy which is reflected as an individual interest in the privacy\nof thought and mind and the development of opinions and beliefs; (vi) decisional\nprivacy reflected by an ability to make intimate decisions primarily consisting one’s\nsexual or procreative nature and decisions in respect of intimate relations; (vii)\nassociational privacy which is reflected in the ability of the individual to choose who\nshe wishes to interact with; (viii) behavioural privacy which recognises the privacy\ninterests of a person even while conducting publicly visible activities. Behavioural\nprivacy postulates that even when access is granted to others, the individual is entitled\nto control the extent of access and preserve to herself a measure of freedom from\nunwanted intrusion; and (ix) informational privacy which reflects an interest in\npreventing information about the self from being disseminated and controlling the\nextent of access to information.\nM      Constituent Assembly and privacy: limits of originalist interpretation\n143    The founding fathers of the Constitution, it has been urged, rejected the notion\nof privacy being a fundamental right. Hence it has been submitted that it would be\noutside the realm of constitutional adjudication for the Court to declare a fundamental\nright to privacy. The argument merits close consideration.\n203\nPART M\n144     On 17 March 1947, K M Munshi submitted Draft articles on the fundamental\nrights and duties of citizens to the Sub-committee on fundamental rights.

If this means that there is to be no search without a\ncourt’s warrant, it may seriously affect the powers of investigation\nof the police. Under the existing law, eg.,\nCriminal Procedure Code\n,\nsection 165 (relevant extracts given below), the police have certain\nimportant powers. Often in the course of investigation, a police\nofficer gets information that stolen property has been secreted in a\ncertain place. If he searches it at once, as he can at present, there\nis a chance of his recovering it; but he has to apply for a court’s\nwarrant, giving full details, the delay involved, under Indian\nconditions of distance and lack of transport in the interior may be\nfatal.”\nA note was submitted by Sir Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer on 10 April 1947 objecting to\nthe ‘secrecy of correspondence’ mentioned in clause 9(d) and the protection against\nunreasonable searches in clause 10326 :\n“Clause (d). In regard to secrecy of correspondence I raised a point\nduring the discussions that it need not find a place in chapter on\nfundamental rights and it had better be left to the protection afforded\nby the ordinary law of the land contained in the various enactments.\nThere is no such right in the American Constitution. Such a\nprovision finds a place only in the post-First World War\nconstitutions.

The opening words of the clause\n“public order and morality” would not be of any avail in such cases.\nOn a very careful consideration of the whole subject I feel that\ninclusion of such a clause in the chapter on fundamental rights will\nlead to endless complications and difficulties in the administration\nof justice. It will be for the committee to consider whether a\nreconsideration of the clause is called for in the above\ncircumstances.\nClause 10. Unreasonable searches, In regard to this subject I\npointed out the difference between the conditions obtaining in\nAmerica at the time when the American Constitution was drafted\nand the conditions in India obtaining at present after the provisions\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Code\nin this behalf have been in force for\nnearly a century. The effect of the clause, as it is, will be to abrogate\nsome of the provisions of the\nCriminal Procedure Code\nand to leave\nit to the Supreme Court in particular cases to decide whether the\nsearch is reasonable or unreasonable. While I am averse to\nreagitating the matter I think it may not be too late for the committee\nto consider this particular clause.”\nDuring the course of the comments and suggestions on the draft Constitution, Jaya\nPrakash Narayan suggested the inclusion of the secrecy of postal, telegraphic and\ntelephonic communications. Such an inclusion was, however, objected to on the\nfollowing grounds327 :\n“…It is also hardly necessary to include secrecy of postal,\ntelegraphic and telephonic communications as a fundamental right\nin the Constitution itself as that might lead to practical difficulties in\nB. Shiva Rao, The Framing of India’s Constitution: A Study, Indian Institute of Public Administration (1968), at\n327\npages 219-220\n206\nPART M\nthe administration of the posts and telegraph department. The\nrelevant laws enacted by the Legislature on the subject (the\nIndian\nPost Office Act, 1898\nand the\nIndian Telegraph Act, 1885\n) permit\ninterception of communications sent through post, telegraph or\ntelephone only in specified circumstances, such as, on the\noccurrence of an emergency and in the interests of public safety.”\nEventually, clause 9(d) and clause 10 were dropped from the chapter dealing with\nfundamental rights.\n148   This discussion would indicate that there was a debate during the course of the\ndrafting of the Constitution on the proposal to guarantee to every citizen the right to\nsecrecy of correspondence in clause 9(d) and the protection to be secure against\nunreasonable searches and seizures in their persons houses, papers and assets. The\nobjection to clause 9(d) was set out in the note of dissent of Sir Alladi Krishnaswamy\nIyer and it was his view that the guarantee of secrecy of correspondence may lead to\nevery private correspondence becoming a state paper. There was also a feeling that\nthis would affect the prosecution especially in cases of conspiracy or abetment.\nSimilarly, his objection to clause 10 was that it would abrogate some of the provisions\nof the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n. B N Rau likewise stated that this would seriously\naffect the powers of investigation of the police. The clause protecting the secrecy of\ncorrespondence was thus dropped on the ground that it would constitute a serious\nimpediment in prosecutions while the protection against unreasonable searches and\nseizures was deleted on the ground that there were provisions in the\nCode of Criminal\nProcedure\n, 1898 covering the area. The debates of the Constituent Assembly indicate\n207\nPART M\nthat the proposed inclusion (which was eventually dropped) was in two specific areas\nnamely correspondence and searches and seizures. From this, it cannot be concluded\nthat the Constituent Assembly had expressly resolved to reject the notion of the right\nto privacy as an integral element of the liberty and freedoms guaranteed by the\nfundamental rights.\n149   The Constitution has evolved over time, as judicial interpretation, led to the\nrecognition of specific interests and entitlements. These have been subsumed within\nthe freedoms and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.\nArticle 21\nhas been\ninterpreted by this Court to mean that life does not mean merely a physical existence.\nIt includes all those faculties by which life is enjoyed. The ambit of ‘the procedure\nestablished by law’ has been interpreted to mean that the procedure must be fair, just\nand reasonable. The coalescence of\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\n21\nhas brought into being a\njurisprudence which recognises the inter-relationship between rights. That is how the\nrequirements of fairness and non-discrimination animate both the substantive and\nprocedural aspects of\nArticle 21.\nThese constitutional developments have taken place\nas the words of the Constitution have been interpreted to deal with new exigencies\nrequiring an expansive reading of liberties and freedoms to preserve human rights\nunder the rule of law. India’s brush with a regime of the suspension of life and personal\nliberty in the not too distant past is a grim reminder of how tenuous liberty can be, if\nthe judiciary is not vigilant. The interpretation of the Constitution cannot be frozen by\nits original understanding. The Constitution has evolved and must continuously evolve\n208\nPART M\nto meet the aspirations and challenges of the present and the future. Nor can judges\nforesee every challenge and contingency which may arise in the future. This is\nparticularly of relevance in an age where technology reshapes our fundamental\nunderstanding of information, knowledge and human relationships that was unknown\neven in the recent past. Hence as Judges interpreting the Constitution today, the\nCourt must leave open the path for succeeding generations to meet the challenges to\nprivacy that may be unknown today.\n150   The impact of the decision in Cooper is to establish a link between the\nfundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. The immediate\nconsequence of the decision is that a law which restricts the personal liberties\ncontained in\nArticle 19\nmust meet the test of permissible restrictions contemplated by\nClauses 2 to 6 in relation to the fundamental freedom which is infringed. Moreover,\nsince the fundamental rights are inter-related,\nArticle 21\nis no longer to be construed\nas a residue of rights which are not specifically enumerated in\nArticle 19.\nBoth sets\nof rights overlap and hence a law which affects one of the personal freedoms under\nArticle 19\nwould, in addition to the requirement of meeting the permissible restrictions\ncontemplated in clauses 2 to 6, have to meet the parameters of a valid ‘procedure\nestablished by law’ under\nArticle 21\nwhere it impacts on life or personal liberty. The\nlaw would be assessed not with reference to its object but on the basis of its effect\nand impact on the fundamental rights. Coupled with the breakdown of the theory that\nthe fundamental rights are water-tight compartments, the post Maneka jurisprudence\ninfused the test of fairness and reasonableness in determining whether the ‘procedure\n209\nPART M\nestablished by law’ passes muster under\nArticle 21.\nAt a substantive level, the\nconstitutional values underlying each article in the Chapter on fundamental rights\nanimate the meaning of the others. This development of the law has followed a natural\nevolution. The basis of this development after all is that every aspect of the diverse\nguarantees of fundamental rights deals with human beings. Every element together\nwith others contributes in the composition of the human personality. In the very nature\nof things, no element can be read in a manner disjunctive from the composite whole.\nThe close relationship between each of the fundamental rights has led to the\nrecognition of constitutional entitlements and interests. Some of them may straddle\nmore than one, and on occasion several, fundamental rights. Yet others may reflect\nthe core value upon which the fundamental rights are founded. Even at the birth of\nthe Constitution, the founding fathers recognised in the Constituent Assembly that, for\ninstance, the freedom of speech and expression would comprehend the freedom of\nthe press. Hence the guarantee of free speech and expression has been interpreted\nto extend to the freedom of the press. Recognition of the freedom of the press does\nnot create by judicial fiat, a new fundamental right but is an acknowledgment of that,\nwhich lies embedded and without which the guarantee of free speech and expression\nwould not be complete.       Similarly,\nArticle 21\nhas been interpreted to include a\nspectrum of entitlements such as a right to a clean environment, the right to public\nhealth, the right to know, the right to means of communication and the right to\neducation, besides a panoply of rights in the context of criminal law and procedure in\nmatters such as handcuffing and speedy trial. The rights which have been held to flow\nout of\nArticle 21\ninclude the following:\n210\nPART M\n(i)     The right to go abroad –\nSatwant Singh Sawhney v D Ramarathnam APO\nNew Delhi\n328.\n(ii)     The right against solitary confinement –\nSunil Batra v Delhi Administration329\n.\n(iii)    The right of prisoners against bar fetters –\nCharles Sobraj v Supdt.

The\nexercise has been one of interpreting existing rights guaranteed by the Constitution\nand while understanding the core of those rights, to define the ambit of what the right\ncomprehends.\n151      The draftsmen of the Constitution had a sense of history both global and\ndomestic– as they attempted to translate their vision of freedom into guarantees\nagainst authoritarian behaviour. The Constitution adopted a democratic form of\ngovernment based on the rule of law. The framers were conscious of the widespread\nabuse of human rights by authoritarian regimes in the two World Wars separated over\na period of two decades. The framers were equally conscious of the injustice suffered\nunder a colonial regime and more recently of the horrors of partition. The backdrop\nof human suffering furnished a reason to preserve a regime of governance based on\nthe rule of law which would be subject to democratic accountability against a violation\nof fundamental freedoms. The content of the fundamental rights evolved over the\n340\n(1978) 4 SCC 494\n341\n(2013) 10 SCC 591\n342\n(1985) 3 SCC 545\n212\nPART M\ncourse of our constitutional history and any discussion of the issues of privacy,\ntogether with its relationship with liberty and dignity, would be incomplete without a\nbrief reference to the course of history as it unravels in precedent. By guaranteeing\nthe freedoms and liberties embodied in the fundamental rights, the Constitution has\npreserved natural rights and ring-fenced them from attempts to attenuate their\nexistence.\nTechnology, as we experience it today is far different from what it was in the lives of\nthe generation which drafted the Constitution. Information technology together with\nthe internet and the social media and all their attendant applications have rapidly\naltered the course of life in the last decade. Today’s technology renders models of\napplication of a few years ago obsolescent. Hence, it would be an injustice both to the\ndraftsmen of the Constitution as well as to the document which they sanctified to\nconstrict its interpretation to an originalist interpretation. Today’s problems have to be\nadjudged by a vibrant application of constitutional doctrine and cannot be frozen by a\nvision suited to a radically different society. We describe the Constitution as a living\ninstrument simply for the reason that while it is a document which enunciates eternal\nvalues for Indian society, it possesses the resilience necessary to ensure its continued\nrelevance. Its continued relevance lies precisely in its ability to allow succeeding\ngenerations to apply the principles on which it has been founded to find innovative\nsolutions to intractable problems of their times.       In doing so, we must equally\nunderstand that our solutions must continuously undergo a process of re-engineering.\n213\nPART N\nN     Is the statutory protection to privacy reason to deny a constitutional right?\n152     The Union government and some of the States which have supported it have\nurged this Court that there is a statutory regime by virtue of which the right to privacy\nis adequately protected and hence it is not necessary to read a constitutional right to\nprivacy into the fundamental rights. This submission is sought to be fortified by\ncontending that privacy is merely a common law right and the statutory protection is\na reflection of that position.\n153     The submission betrays lack of understanding of the reason why rights are\nprotected in the first place as entrenched guarantees in a Bill of Rights or, as in the\ncase of the Indian Constitution, as part of the fundamental rights. Elevating a right to\nthe position of a constitutionally protected right places it beyond the pale of legislative\nmajorities. When a constitutional right such as the right to equality or the right to life\nassumes the character of being a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it\nassumes inviolable status: inviolability even in the face of the power of amendment.\nOrdinary legislation is not beyond the pale of legislative modification. A statutory right\ncan be modified, curtailed or annulled by a simple enactment of the legislature. In\nother words, statutory rights are subject to the compulsion of legislative majorities.\nThe purpose of infusing a right with a constitutional element is precisely to provide it\na sense of immunity from popular opinion and, as its reflection, from legislative\nannulment. Constitutionally protected rights embody the liberal belief that personal\nliberties of the individual are so sacrosanct that it is necessary to ensconce them in a\n214\nPART O\nprotective shell that places them beyond the pale of ordinary legislation. To negate a\nconstitutional right on the ground that there is an available statutory protection is to\ninvert constitutional theory. As a matter of fact, legislative protection is in many cases,\nan acknowledgment and recognition of a constitutional right which needs to be\neffectuated and enforced through protective laws.\nFor instance, the provisions of\nSection 8(1)(j)\nof the Right to Information Act, 2005\nwhich contain an exemption from the disclosure of information refer to such\ninformation which would cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the\nindividual.\nBut the important point to note is that when a right is conferred with an entrenched\nconstitutional status in Part III, it provides a touchstone on which the validity of\nexecutive decision making can be assessed and the validity of law can be determined\nby judicial review. Entrenched constitutional rights provide the basis of evaluating the\nvalidity of law. Hence, it would be plainly unacceptable to urge that the existence of\nlaw negates the rationale for a constitutional right or renders the constitutional right\nunnecessary.\nO      Not an elitist construct\n154    The Attorney General argued before us that the right to privacy must be\nforsaken in the interest of welfare entitlements provided by the State. In our view, the\nsubmission that the right to privacy is an elitist construct which stands apart from the\n215\nPART O\nneeds and aspirations of the large majority constituting the rest of society, is\nunsustainable. This submission betrays a misunderstanding of the constitutional\nposition. Our Constitution places the individual at the forefront of its focus,\nguaranteeing civil and political rights in Part III and embodying an aspiration for\nachieving socio- economic rights in Part IV. The refrain that the poor need no civil\nand political rights and are concerned only with economic well-being has been utilised\nthough history to wreak the most egregious violations of human rights. Above all, it\nmust be realised that it is the right to question, the right to scrutinize and the right to\ndissent which enables an informed citizenry to scrutinize the actions of government.\nThose who are governed are entitled to question those who govern, about the\ndischarge of their constitutional duties including in the provision of socio-economic\nwelfare benefits. The power to scrutinize and to reason enables the citizens of a\ndemocratic polity to make informed decisions on basic issues which govern their\nrights. The theory that civil and political rights are subservient to socio-economic rights\nhas been urged in the past and has been categorically rejected in the course of\nconstitutional adjudication by this Court.\n155    Civil and political rights and socio-economic rights do not exist in a state of\nantagonism. The conditions necessary for realising or fulfilling socio-economic rights\ndo not postulate the subversion of political freedom. The reason for this is simple.\nSocio-economic entitlements must yield true benefits to those for whom they are\nintended. This can be achieved by eliminating rent-seeking behaviour and by\n216\nPART O\npreventing the capture of social welfare benefits by persons who are not entitled to\nthem. Capture of social welfare benefits can be obviated only when political systems\nare transparent and when there is a free flow of information. Opacity enures to the\nbenefit of those who monopolize scarce economic resources. On the other hand,\nconditions where civil and political freedoms flourish ensure that governmental\npolicies are subjected to critique and assessment. It is this scrutiny which sub-serves\nthe purpose of ensuring that socio-economic benefits actually permeate to the under-\nprivileged for whom they are meant. Conditions of freedom and a vibrant assertion of\ncivil and political rights promote a constant review of the justness of socio-economic\nprogrammes and of their effectiveness in addressing deprivation and want. Scrutiny\nof public affairs is founded upon the existence of freedom. Hence civil and political\nrights and socio-economic rights are complementary and not mutually exclusive.\n156        Some of these themes have been addressed in the writings of the Nobel\nlaureate, Amartya Sen. Sen compares the response of many non-democratic regimes\nin critical situations such as famine with the responses of democratic societies in\nsimilar situations.343 His analysis reveals that the political immunity enjoyed by\ngovernment leaders in authoritarian states prevents effective measures being taken\nto address such conditions:\n“For example, Botswana had a fall in food production of 17 percent\nand Zimbabwe one of 38 percent between 1979-1981 and 1983-\n1984, in the same period in which the food production decline\n343\nAmartya Sen, Development as Freedom, Oxford University Press (2000), at page 178-179\n217\nPART O\namounted to a relatively modest 11 or 12 percent in Sudan and\nEthiopia. But while Sudan and Ethiopia, with comparatively smaller\ndeclines in food output, had massive famines, Botswana and\nZimbabwe had none, and this was largely due to timely and\nextensive famine prevention policies by these latter countries.\nHad the governments in Botswana and Zimbabwe failed to\nundertake timely action, they would have been under severe\ncriticism and pressure from the opposition and would have gotten\nplenty of flak from newspapers. In contrast, the Ethiopian and\nSudanese governments did not have to reckon with those\nprospects, and the political incentives provided by democratic\ninstitutions were thoroughly absent in those countries. Famines in\nSudan and Ethiopia – and in many other countries in sub-Saharan\nAfrica – were fed by the political immunity enjoyed by governmental\nleaders in authoritarian countries. This would seem to apply to the\npresent situation in North Korea as well.”344\nIn the Indian context, Sen points out that the Bengal famine of 1943 “was made viable\nnot only by the lack of democracy in colonial India but also by severe restrictions on\nreporting and criticism imposed on the Indian press, and the voluntary practice of\n‘silence’ on the famine that the British-owned media chose to follow”345. Political\nliberties and democratic rights are hence regarded as ‘constituent components’ of\ndevelopment.346 In contrast during the drought which took place in Maharashtra in\n1973, food production failed drastically and the per capita food output was half of that\nin sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there was no famine in Maharashtra where five million\npeople were employed in rapidly organized public projects while there were\n344\nIbid, at page 179\n345\nAmartya Sen, The Idea of Justice, Penguin Books (2009), at page 339\n346\nIbid, at page 347\n218\nPART O\nsubstantial famines in sub-Saharan Africa. This establishes what he terms as “the\nprotective role of democracy”. Sen has analysed the issue succinctly:\n“The causal connection between democracy and the non-\noccurrence of famines is not hard to seek. Famines kill millions of\npeople in different countries in the world, but they don’t kill the\nrulers. The kings and the presidents, the bureaucrats and the\nbosses, the military leaders and the commanders never are famine\nvictims. And if there are no elections, no opposition parties, no\nscope for uncensored public criticism, then those in authority don’t\nhave to suffer the political consequences of their failure to prevent\nfamines. Democracy, on the other hand, would spread the penalty\nof famines to the ruling groups and political leaders as well. This\ngives them the political incentive to try to prevent any threatening\nfamine, and since famines are in fact easy to prevent (the economic\nargument clicks into the political one at this stage), the approaching\nfamines are firmly prevented.”347\nThere is, in other words, an intrinsic relationship between development and freedom:\n“…development cannot really be seen merely as the process of\nincreasing inanimate objects of convenience, such as raising the\nGNP per head, or promoting industrialization or technological\nadvance or social modernization. These accomplishments are, of\ncourse, valuable – often crucially important – but their value must\ndepend on what they do to the lives and freedoms of the people\ninvolved. For adult human beings, with responsibility for choice, the\nfocus must ultimately be on whether they have the freedom to do\nwhat they have reason to value. In this sense, development consists\nof expansion of people’s freedom.”348\n347\nAmartya Sen, Development as Freedom, Oxford University Press (2000), at page 180\n348\nAmartya Sen, “The Country of First Boys”, Oxford University Press, Pg.80-81\n219\nPART O\nIn an article recently published in July 2017 in Public Law, titled “The Untapped\nPotential of the Mandela Constitution”349, Justice Edwin Cameron, a distinguished\njudge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, has provided a telling example.\nPresident Mbeki of South Africa doubted the medical science underlying AIDS and\neffectively obstructed a feasible ARV programme. This posture of AIDS denialism\nplunged South Africa into a crisis of public health as a result of which the drug\nNevirapine which was offered to the South African government free of charge was\nrefused. Eventually it was when the South African Constitutional Court intervened in\nthe Treatment Action Campaign decision350 that it was held that the government\nhad failed the reasonableness test. The article notes that as a result of the decision,\nthe drug became available and “hundreds and thousands, perhaps millions, of lives\nhave been saved”. Besides, the article notes that the judgment changed the public\ndiscourse of AIDS and “cut-through the obfuscation of denials and in doing so, dealt\nit a fatal blow”351.\nExamples can be multiplied on how a state sanctioned curtain of misinformation or\nstate mandated black-outs of information can cause a serious denial of socio-\neconomic rights. The strength of Indian democracy lies in the foundation provided by\n349\nEdwin Cameron and Max Taylor, “The Untapped Potential of the Mandela Constitution”, Public Law (2017),\nat page 394\n350\nMinister of Health v Treatment Action Campaign, (2002) 5 SA 721 (CC)\n351\nEdwin Cameron and Max Taylor, “The Untapped Potential of the Mandela Constitution”, Public Law (2017),\nat page 395\n220\nPART P\nthe Constitution to liberty and freedom. Liberty and freedom are values which are\nintrinsic to our constitutional order. But they also have an instrumental value in\ncreating conditions in which socio-economic rights can be achieved. India has no iron\ncurtain. Our society prospers in the shadow of its drapes which let in sunshine and\nreflect a multitude of hues based on language, religion, culture and ideologies.\n157   We need also emphasise the lack of substance in the submission that privacy\nis a privilege for the few. Every individual in society irrespective of social class or\neconomic status is entitled to the intimacy and autonomy which privacy protects. It is\nprivacy as an intrinsic and core feature of life and personal liberty which enables an\nindividual to stand up against a programme of forced sterilization. Then again, it is\nprivacy which is a powerful guarantee if the State were to introduce compulsory drug\ntrials of non-consenting men or women. The sanctity of marriage, the liberty of\nprocreation, the choice of a family life and the dignity of being are matters which\nconcern every individual irrespective of social strata or economic well being. The\npursuit of happiness is founded upon autonomy and dignity. Both are essential\nattributes of privacy which makes no distinction between the birth marks of individuals.\nP     Not just a common law right\n158   There is also no merit in the defence of the Union and the States that privacy\nis merely a common law right. The fact that a right may have been afforded protection\nat common law does not constitute a bar to the constitutional recognition of the right.\n221\nPART P\nThe Constitution recognises the right simply because it is an incident of a fundamental\nfreedom or liberty which the draftsperson considered to be so significant as to require\nconstitutional protection. Once privacy is held to be an incident of the protection of\nlife, personal liberty and of the liberties guaranteed by the provisions of Part III of the\nConstitution, the submission that privacy is only a right at common law misses the\nwood for the trees. The central theme is that privacy is an intrinsic part of life, personal\nliberty and of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III which entitles it to protection as a\ncore of constitutional doctrine. The protection of privacy by the Constitution liberates\nit, as it were, from the uncertainties of statutory law which, as we have noted, is subject\nto the range of legislative annulments open to a majoritarian government.                         Any\nabridgment must meet the requirements prescribed by\nArticle 21\n,\nArticle 19\nor the\nrelevant freedom. The Constitutional right is placed at a pedestal which embodies\nboth a negative and a positive freedom. The negative freedom protects the individual\nfrom unwanted intrusion. As a positive freedom, it obliges the State to adopt suitable\nmeasures for protecting individual privacy. An apt description of this facet is contained\nin the Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Comparative Constitutional Law, in its\nsection on the right to privacy352 :\n“2. The right to privacy can be both negatively and positively\ndefined. The negative right to privacy entails the individuals are\nprotected from unwanted intrusion by both the state and private\nactors into their private life, especially features that define their\npersonal identity such as sexuality, religion and political affiliation,\nie the inner core of a person’s private life….\n352\nAnna Jonsson Cornell, “Right to Privacy”, Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Comparative Constitutional Law\n(2015)\n222\nPART Q\nThe positive right to privacy entails an obligation of states to remove\nobstacles for an autonomous shaping of individual identities.”\nQ      Substantive Due Process\n159    During the course of the hearing, Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel\nappearing on behalf of the State of Gujarat submitted that the requirement of a valid\nlaw with reference to\nArticle 21\nis not conditioned by the notion of substantive due\nprocess. Substantive due process, it was urged is a concept which has been evolved\nin relation to the US Constitution but is inapposite in relation to the Indian Constitution.\nThe history surrounding the drafting of\nArticle 21\nindicates a conscious decision by\nthe Constituent Assembly not to introduce the expression “due process of law” which\nis incorporated in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution. The\ndraft Constitution which was prepared by the Drafting Committee chaired by Dr B R\nAmbedkar contained a ‘due process’ clause to the effect that ‘nor any State shall\ndeprive any person of life, liberty and property without due process of law’. The clause\nas originally drafted was subjected to three important changes in the Constituent\nAssembly. Firstly, the reference to property was deleted from the above clause of the\ndraft Constitution. The members of the Constituent Assembly perceived that retaining\nthe right to property as part of the due process clause would pose a serious\nimpediment to legislative reform particularly with the redistribution of property. The\nsecond important change arose from a meeting which Shri B N Rau had with Justice\n223\nPART Q\nFelix Frankfurter in the US. In the US particularly in the years around the Great\nDepression, American Courts had utilised the due process clause to invalidate social\nwelfare legislation. In the Lochner353 era, the US Supreme Court invalidated\nlegislation such as statutes prohibiting employers from making their employees work\nfor more than ten hours a day or sixty hours a week on the supposition that this\ninfringed the liberty of contract. Between 1899 and 1937 (excluding the civil rights\ncases), 159 US Supreme Court decisions held state statutes unconstitutional under\nthe due process and equal protection clauses. Moreover, 25 other statutes were\nstruck down under the due process clause together with other provisions of the\nAmerican Constitution.354 Under the due process clause, the US Supreme Court\nstruck down labour legislation prohibiting employers from discriminating on the\ngrounds of union activity; regulation of wages; regulation of prices for commodities\nand services; and legislation denying entry into business. 355 These decisions were\neventually distinguished or overruled in 1937 and thereafter.356\n160     The Constituent Assembly, in this background, made a second important\nchange in the original draft by qualifying the expression ‘liberty’ with the word\n‘personal’. Shri B N Rau suggested that if this qualification were not to be introduced,\n353\nLochner v New York, 198 US 45 (1905)\n354\nWilliam B Lockhart, et al, Constitutional Law: Cases- Comments-Questions, West Publishing Co.

In the United States he met\nSupreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, who told him that he\nconsidered the power of judicial review implied in the due process\nclause both undemocratic – because a few judges could veto\nlegislation enacted by the representatives of a nation – and\nburdensome to the Judiciary. Frankfurter had been strongly\ninfluenced by the Harvard Law School’s great constitutional lawyer,\nJames Bradley Thayer, who also feared that too great a reliance on\ndue process as a protection against legislative oversight or\nmisbehaviour might weaken the democratic process. Thayer’s\nviews had impressed Rau even before he met Frankfurter. In his\nConstitutional Precedents, Rau had pointed out that Thayer and\nothers had ‘drawn attention to the dangers of attempting to find in\nthe Supreme Court – instead of in the lessons of experience – a\nsafeguard against the mistakes of the representatives of people’.”\n357\nB.

In his words360 :\n“…In the development of the doctrine of ‘due process’ the United\nStates Supreme Court has not adopted a consistent view at all and\nthe decisions are conflicting…\nThe Minimum Wage Law or a Restraint on Employment have in\nsome cases been regarded as an invasion of personal liberty and\nfreedom, by the United States Supreme Court in its earlier\ndecisions, the theory being that it is an essential part of personal\nliberty that every person in the world be she a woman, be he a child\nover fourteen years of age or be he a labourer, has the right to enter\ninto any contract he or she liked and it is not the province of other\npeople to interfere with that liberty. On that ground, in the earlier\ndecisions of Supreme Court it has been held that the Minimum\nWages Laws are invalid as invading personal liberty…\nThe clause may serve as a great handicap for all social legislation,\nand for the protection of women…\nI trust that the House will take into account the various aspects of\nthis question, the future progress of India, the well-being and the\nsecurity of the States, the necessity of maintaining a minimum of\nliberty, the need for co-ordinating social control and personal liberty,\nbefore coming to a decision. One thing also will have to be taken\ninto account, viz., that the security of the State is far from being so\nsecure as we are imagining at present…”\nOn the other hand, several members of the Constituent Assembly preferred the\nretention of the phrase ‘due process’, among them being Dr Sitaramayya, T T\nKrishnamachari, K Santhanam, M A Ayyangar, Dr B V Keskar, S L Saksena, Thakur\n359\nConstituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 7 (6th December 1948), available at\nhttp://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/vol7p20b.htm\n360\nIbid\n226\nPART Q\nDas Bhargava, Hukam Singh and four members of the Muslim League.361 K M Munshi\nstated that362 :\n“…a substantive interpretation of due process could not apply to\nliberty of contract – the basis on which the United States Supreme\nCourt had, at the beginning of the century, declared some social\nlegislation to be an infringement of due process and hence\nunconstitutional – but only to liberty of person, because ‘personal’\nhad been added to qualify liberty. ‘When a law has been passed\nwhich entitles the government to take away the personal liberty of\nan individual, Munshi said, ‘the court will consider whether the law\nwhich has been passed is such as is required by the exigencies of\nthe case and therefore, as I said, the balance will be struck between\nindividual liberty and social control. Other Assembly members\nagreed: whilst not wishing to impede the passage of social reform\nlegislation they sought to protect the individual’s personal liberty\nagainst prejudicial action by an arbitrary Executive.”\nDr B R Ambedkar in an insightful observation, presented the merits and demerits of\nthe rival viewpoints dispassionately. In his words363 :\n“There are two views on this point. One view is this; that the\nlegislature may be trusted not to make any law which would\nabrogate the fundamental rights of man, so to say, the fundamental\nrights which apply to every individual, and consequently, there is no\ndanger arising from the introduction of the phrase ‘due process’.\nAnother view is this : that it is not possible to trust the legislature;\nthe legislature is likely to err, is likely to be led away by passion, by\nparty prejudice, by party considerations, and the legislature may\nmake a law which may abrogate what may be regarded as the\nfundamental principles which safeguard the individual rights of a\ncitizen. We are therefore placed in two difficult positions. One is to\ngive the judiciary the authority to sit in judgment over the will of the\nlegislature and to question the law made by the legislature on the\nground that it is not good law, in consonance with fundamental\nprinciples. Is that a desirable principle? The second position is that\n361\nGranville Austin (Supra note 358), at page 105\n362\nIbid, at pages 105-106\n363\nConstituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 7 (13th December 1948), available at\nhttp://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/vol7p25a.htm\n227\nPART Q\nthe legislature ought to be trusted not to make bad laws. It is very\ndifficult to come to any definite conclusion. There are dangers on\nboth sides. For myself I cannot altogether omit the possibility of a\nLegislature packed by party men making laws which may abrogate\nor violate what we regard as certain fundamental principles\naffecting the life and liberty of an individual. At the same time, I do\nnot see how five or six gentlemen sitting in the Federal or Supreme\nCourt examining laws made by the Legislature and by dint of their\nown individual conscience or their bias or their prejudices be trusted\nto determine which law is good and which law is bad. It is rather a\ncase where a man has to sail between Charybdis and Scylla and I\ntherefor would not say anything. I would leave it to the House to\ndecide in any way it likes.”\nThe amendments proposed by some members to reintroduce ‘due process’ were\nrejected on 13 December 1948 and the phrase “due process of law” was deleted from\nthe original draft Constitution. However,\nArticle 22\nwas introduced into the Constitution\nto protect against arbitrary arrest and detention by incorporating several safeguards.\n162   In Gopalan, the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 was challenged on the ground\nthat it denied significant procedural safeguards against arbitrary detention. The\nmajority rejected the argument that the expression ‘procedure established by law’\nmeant procedural due process. Chief Justice Kania noted that\nArticle 21\nof our\nConstitution had consciously been drawn up by the draftsmen so as to not use the\nword ‘due process’ which was used in the American Constitution. Hence it was\nimpermissible to read the expression ‘procedure established by law’ to mean\n‘procedural due process’ or as requiring compliance with natural justice. Justice\nPatanjali Sastri held that reading the expression ‘due process of law’ into the\nConstitution was impermissible since it would lead to those ‘subtle and elusive criteria’\n228\nPART Q\nimplied in the phrase which it was the deliberate purpose of the framers of our\nConstitution to avoid. Similarly, Justice Das also observed that our Constitution\nmakers had deliberately declined to adopt “the uncertain and shifting American\ndoctrine of due process of law” which could not, therefore, be read into\nArticle 21.\nHence, the view of the majority was that once the procedure was established by a\nvalidly enacted law,\nArticle 21\nwould not be violated.\n163    In his celebrated dissent, Justice Fazl Ali pointed out that the phrase ‘procedure\nestablished by law’ was borrowed from the Japanese Constitution (which was drafted\nunder American influence at the end of the Second World War) and hence the\nexpression means ‘procedural due process’. In Justice Fazl Ali’s view the deprivation\nof life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21\n, had to be preceded by (i) a notice; (ii) an\nopportunity of being heard; (iii) adjudication by an impartial tribunal; and (iv) an orderly\ncourse of procedure. Formulating these four principles, Justice Fazl Ali held thus:\n“…Article 21 purports to protect life and personal liberty, and it\nwould be a precarious protection and a protection not worth having,\nif the elementary principle of law under discussion which, according\nto Halsbury is on a par with fundamental rights, is to be ignored and\nexcluded. In the course of his arguments, the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner repeatedly asked whether the Constitution would\npermit a law being enacted, abolishing the mode of trial permitted\nby the existing law and establishing the procedure of trial by battle\nor trial by ordeal which was in vogue in olden times in England. The\nquestion envisages something which is not likely to happen, but it\ndoes raise a legal problem which can perhaps be met only in this\nway that if the expression “procedure established by law” simply\nmeans any procedure established or enacted by statute it will be\ndifficult to give a negative answer to the question, but if the word\n“law” includes what I have endeavoured to show it does, such an\nanswer may be justified. It seems to me that there is nothing\n229\nPART Q\nrevolutionary in the doctrine that the words “procedure established\nby law” must include the four principles set out in Professor Willis’\nbook, which, as I have already stated, are different aspects of the\nsame principle and which have no vagueness or uncertainty about\nthem. These principles, as the learned author points out and as the\nauthorities show, are not absolutely rigid principles but are\nadaptable to the circumstances of each case within certain limits. I\nhave only to add that it has not been seriously controverted that\n“law” in this article means valid law and “procedure” means certain\ndefinite rules of proceeding and not something which is a mere\npretence for procedure.”364\nIn Maneka, where the passport of the petitioner was impounded without furnishing\nreasons, a majority of judges found that the expression ‘procedure established by law’\ndid not mean any procedure howsoever arbitrary or fanciful. The procedure had to be\nfair, just and reasonable. The views of Justices Chandrachud, Bhagwati and Krishna\nIyer emerge from the following brief extracts:\n“Chandrachud, J.:\n…But the mere prescription of some kind of procedure cannot ever\nmeet the mandate of\nArticle 21.\nThe procedure prescribed by law\nhas to be fair, just and reasonable, not fanciful, oppressive or\narbitrary.”365\n“Bhagwati, J.:\nThe principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as\nphilosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-\narbitrariness pervades\nArticle 14\nlike a brooding omnipresence and\nthe procedure contemplated by\nArticle 21\nmust answer the test of\nreasonableness in order to be in conformity with\nArticle 14.\nIt must\nbe “right and just and fair” and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive;\notherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of\nArticle 21\nwould not be satisfied.”366\n364\nGopalan\n(Supra note 3), at pages 60-61 (para 77)\n365\nManeka (Supra note 5), at page 323 (para 48)\n366\nIbid, at page 284 (para 7)\n230\nPART Q\n“Krishna Iyer, J.:\n…So I am convinced that to frustrate\nArticle 21\nby relying on any\nformal adjectival statute, however, flimsy or fantastic its provisions\nbe, is to rob what the constitution treasures.\n…To sum up, “procedure” in\nArticle 21\nmeans fair, not formal\nprocedure. “Law” is reasonable law, not any enacted piece.”367\nSoon after the decision in Maneka, the Supreme Court considered a challenge to the\nprovisions for solitary confinement under\nSection 30(2)\nof the Prisons Act, 1894 which\nstipulated that a prisoner “under sentence of death” is to be kept in a cell apart from\nother prisoners.\nIn\nSunil Batra v Delhi Administration368\n, the Court pointed out that\nSections 73 and 74 of the Penal Code which contain a substantive punishment by\nway of solitary confinement was not under challenge.\nSection 30(2)\nof the Prisons\nAct was read down by holding that the expression “under sentence of death” would\napply only after the entire process of remedies had been exhausted by the convict\nand the clemency petition had been denied. Justice D A Desai, speaking for the\nmajority, held that:\n“…the word “law” in the expression “procedure established by law”\nin\nArticle 21\nhas been interpreted to mean in Maneka Gandhi’s case\nthat the law must be right, just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or\noppressive.”369\n367\nIbid, at page 338 (paras 82 and 85)\n368\n(1978) 4 SCC 494\n369\nIbid, at pages 574-575 (para 228)\n231\nPART Q\nJustice Krishna Iyer took note of the fact that our Constitution does not contain a due\nprocess clause and opined that after the decision in Maneka, the absence of such a\nclause would make no difference:\n“…true, our Constitution has no ‘due process’ clause or the VIIIth\nAmendment; but, in this branch of law, after Cooper and Maneka\nGandhi the consequence is the same.”370\n164      A substantive challenge to the constitutional validity of the death penalty on a\nconviction on a charge of murder was raised in Bachan Singh371. The judgment\nnoted:\n“136.\nArticle 21\nreads as under:\n“No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty\nexcept according to procedure established by law.”\nIf this Article is expanded in accordance with the interpretative\nprinciple indicated in Maneka Gandhi, it will read as follows:\n“No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty\nexcept according to fair, just and reasonable procedure\nestablished by valid law.\"\nIn the converse positive form, the expanded Article will read as\nbelow:\n“A person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty in\naccordance with fair, just and reasonable procedure\nestablished by valid law.””372\nBachan Singh clearly involved a substantive challenge to the constitutional validity\nof a statutory provision. The majority adjudicated upon the constitutional challenge\nunder\nArticle 21\nand held that it did not suffer from substantive or procedural invalidity.\n370\nIbid, at page 518 (para 52)\n371\n(1980) 2 SCC 684\n372\nIbid, at page 730 (para 136)\n232\nPART Q\nIn his dissent373, Justice Bhagwati significantly observed that the word “procedure”\nunder\nArticle 21\nwould cover the entire process by which deprivation is effected and\nthat would include not only “the adjectival” but also substantive part of law. In the view\nof the Court:\n“The word ‘procedure’ in\nArticle 21\nis wide enough to cover the\nentire process by which deprivation is effected and that would\ninclude not only the adjectival but also the substantive part of\nlaw.”374\nIn Mithu v State of Punjab375 (“Mithu”), a Constitution Bench considered the validity\nof Section 303 of the Penal Code which provided for a mandatory death penalty where\na person commits murder while undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment. Section\n303 excluded the procedural safeguards under\nSection 235(2)\nand\n354(3)\nof the\nCriminal Procedure Code under which the accused is required to be heard on the\nquestion of sentence and “special reasons” need to be adduced for imposing the\ndeath sentence. In the course of the judgment, Chandrachud C J indicated examples\nof situations where a substantive enactment could be challenged on the touchstone\nof\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\nThe observations of the Court, which are extracted below would\nindicate that while the Court did not use the expression “substantive due process” it\nrecognised that a law would be amenable to challenge under\nArticle 21\nnot only on\nthe ground that the procedure which it prescribes is not fair, just and reasonable but\n373\n(1982) 3 SCC 24\n374\nIbid, at page 55 (para 17)\n375\n(1983) 2 SCC 277\n233\nPART Q\non the touchstone of having imposed a penalty which is savage or, as the Court held,\nan anathema of civilised jurisprudence :\n“These decisions have expanded the scope of\nArticle 21\nin a\nsignificant way and it is now too late in the day to contend that it is\nfor the legislature to prescribe the procedure and for the courts to\nfollow it; that it is for the legislature to provide the punishment and\nfor the courts to impose it. Two instances, undoubtedly extreme,\nmay be taken by way of illustration for the purpose of showing how\nthe courts are not bound, and are indeed not free, to apply a\nfanciful procedure by a blind adherence to the letter of the law\nor to impose a savage sentence. A law providing that an\naccused shall not be allowed to lead evidence in self-defence\nwill be hit by\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\nSimilarly, if a law were to\nprovide that the offence of theft will be punishable with the\npenalty of the cutting of hands, the law will be bad as violating\nArticle 21.\nA savage sentence is anathema to the civilized\njurisprudence of\nArticle 21.\nThese are, of course, extreme\nillustrations and we need have no fear that our legislatures will ever\npass such laws. But these examples serve to illustrate that the\nlast word on the question of justice and fairness does not rest\nwith the legislature. Just as reasonableness of restrictions under\nclauses (2) to (6) of\nArticle 19\nis for the courts to determine, so is it\nfor the courts to decide whether the procedure prescribed by a law\nfor depriving a person of his life or liberty is fair, just and reasonable.\nThe question which then arises before us is whether the sentence\nof death, prescribed by Section 303 of the Penal Code for the\noffence of murder committed by a person who is under a sentence\nof life imprisonment, is arbitrary and oppressive so as to be violative\nof the fundamental right conferred by Article 21.”376\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn\nA K Roy v Union of India377\n, dealing with the question of preventive detention, a\nConstitution Bench of this Court adverted to the conscious decision in the Constituent\n376\nIbid, at pages 284-285 (para 6)\n377\n(1982) 1 SCC 271\n234\nPART Q\nAssembly to delete the expression ‘due process of law’ from\nArticle 21.\nThe Court held\nthat:\n“The fact that England and America do not resort to preventive\ndetention in normal times was known to our Constituent Assembly\nand yet it chose to provide for it, sanctioning its use for specified\npurposes. The attitude of two other well-known democracies to\npreventive detention as a means of regulating the lives and liberties\nof the people was undoubtedly relevant to the framing of our\nConstitution. But the framers having decided to adopt and legitimise\nit, we cannot declare it unconstitutional by importing our notions of\nwhat is right and wrong. The power to judge the fairness and\njustness of procedure established by a law for the purposes of\nArticle 21\nis one thing: that power can be spelt out from the\nlanguage of that article. Procedural safeguards are the\nhandmaids of equal justice and since, the power of the\ngovernment is colossal as compared with the power of an\nindividual, the freedom of the individual can be safe only if he\nhas a guarantee that he will be treated fairly. The power to\ndecide upon the justness of the law itself is quite another\nthing: that power springs from a ‘due process’ provision such\nas is to be found in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the\nAmerican Constitution by which no person can be deprived of\nlife, liberty or property “without due process of law”.”378\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn\nSaroj Rani v Sudarshan Kumar379\n, this Court upheld the constitutional validity of\nthe provision for restitution of conjugal rights contained in\nSection 9\nof the Hindu\nMarriage Act, 1955. The Court found that the provision served a social purpose of\npreventing the breakdown of marriages and contained safeguards against its being\nused arbitrarily.\n378\nIbid, at page 301 (para 35)\n379\n(1984) 4 SCC 90\n235\nPART Q\nIn Mohd. Arif v Supreme Court380, a Constitution Bench of this Court held that the\nexpression “reasonable procedure” in the context of\nArticle 21\nwould encompass an\noral hearing of review petitions arising out of death penalties. Tracing the history of\nthe evolution of\nArticle 21\n, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, speaking for the majority in\nthe Constitution Bench, observed as follows:\n“The wheel has turned full circle. Substantive due process is now to\nbe applied to the fundamental right to life and liberty.”381\nMore recently, Justice Chelameswar, speaking for a Bench of two judges in\nRajbala\nv State of Haryana382\n, has struck a note of caution, by drawing attention to the\nposition that the expression ‘due process of law’ was consciously deleted in the\ndrafting process after the framing of the Constitution. Hence, in the view of the learned\nJudge, it would be inappropriate to incorporate notions of substantive due process\nadopted in the US while examining the constitutionality of Indian legislation. The Court\nobserved:\n“From the above extract from McDowell & Co. case it is clear that\nthe courts in this country do not undertake the task of\ndeclaring a piece of legislation unconstitutional on the ground\nthat the legislation is “arbitrary” since such an exercise implies\na value judgment and courts do not examine the wisdom of\nsome specific provision of the Constitution. To undertake\nsuch an examination would amount to virtually importing the\ndoctrine of “substantive due process” employed by the\nAmerican Supreme Court at an earlier point of time while\nexamining the constitutionality of Indian legislation. As pointed\nout in the above extract, even in United States the doctrine is\ncurrently of doubtful legitimacy. This Court long back in A.S.\n380\n(2014)\n9\nSCC 737\n381\nIbid, at page 756 (para 28)\n382\n(2016) 2 SCC 445\n236\nPART Q\nKrishna v. State of Madras [1957 SCR 399] declared that the\ndoctrine of due process has no application under the Indian\nConstitution. As pointed out by Frankfurter, J. arbitrariness became\na mantra.”383        (emphasis supplied)\nThe constitutional history surrounding the drafting of\nArticle 21\ncontains an abundant\nreflection of a deliberate and studied decision of the Constituent Assembly to delete\nthe expression ‘due process of law’ from the draft Constitution when the Constitution\nwas adopted. In the Constituent Assembly, the Drafting Committee chaired by Dr B\nR Ambedkar had included the phrase but it came to be deleted after a careful\nevaluation of the vagaries of the decision making process in the US involving\ninterpretation of the due process clause. Significantly, present to the mind of the\nframers of our Constitution was the invalidation of social welfare legislation in the US\non the anvil of the due process clause on the ground that it violated the liberty of\ncontract of men, women and children to offer themselves for work in a free market for\nlabour. This model evidently did not appeal to those who opposed the incorporation\nof a similar phrase into the Indian Constitution.\nYet the debates in the Constituent Assembly indicate that there was a substantial\nbody of opposition to the deletion of the due process clause, which eventually led Dr\nB R Ambedkar to objectively sum up the rival view points for decision by the House.\nEvidently ‘due process’ was substituted with the expression ‘procedure established by\nlaw’. ‘Liberty’ was qualified by ‘personal’.\n383\nIbid, at page 481 (para 64)\n237\nPART Q\nHaving noticed this, the evolution of\nArticle 21\n, since the decision in Cooper indicates\ntwo major areas of change. First, the fundamental rights are no longer regarded as\nisolated silos or water tight compartments. In consequence,\nArticle 14\nhas been held\nto animate the content of\nArticle 21.\nSecond, the expression ‘procedure established\nby law’ in\nArticle 21\ndoes not connote a formalistic requirement of a mere presence of\nprocedure in enacted law. That expression has been held to signify the content of the\nprocedure and its quality which must be fair, just and reasonable. The mere fact that\nthe law provides for the deprivation of life or personal liberty is not sufficient to\nconclude its validity and the procedure to be constitutionally valid must be fair, just\nand reasonable. The quality of reasonableness does not attach only to the content of\nthe procedure which the law prescribes with reference to\nArticle 21\nbut to the content\nof the law itself. In other words, the requirement of\nArticle 21\nis not fulfilled only by the\nenactment of fair and reasonable procedure under the law and a law which does so\nmay yet be susceptible to challenge on the ground that its content does not accord\nwith the requirements of a valid law. The law is open to substantive challenge on the\nground that it violates the fundamental right.\nIn dealing with a substantive challenge to a law on the ground that it violates a\nfundamental right, there are settled principles of constitutional interpretation which\nhold the field. The first is the presumption of constitutionality384 which is based on the\n384\nCharanjit Lal Chowdhury v. The Union of India\n, AIR 1951 SC 41 ;\nRam Krishna Dalmia v.

The burden lies on the individual who\nasserts a constitutional transgression to establish it. Secondly, the Courts tread warily\nin matters of social and economic policy where they singularly lack expertise to make\nevaluations. Policy making is entrusted to the state.385\nThe doctrine of separation of powers requires the Court to allow deference to the\nlegislature whose duty it is to frame and enact law and to the executive whose duty it\nis to enforce law. The Court would not, in the exercise of judicial review, substitute its\nown opinion for the wisdom of the law enacting or law enforcing bodies.\nIn the context\nof\nArticle 19\n, the test of reasonableness was explained in the erudite words of Chief\nJustice Patanjali Sastri in\nState of Madras v V G Row386\n, where the learned Chief\nJustice held thus:\n“It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of\nreasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each\nindividual statute impugned, and no abstract standard, or general\npattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all\ncases.

When\nthe validity of a law is questioned on the ground that it violates a guarantee contained\nin\nArticle 21\n, the scope of the challenge is not confined only to whether the procedure\nfor the deprivation of life or personal liberty is fair, just and reasonable. Substantive\nchallenges to the validity of laws encroaching upon the right to life or personal liberty\nhas been considered and dealt with in varying contexts, such as the death penalty\n(Bachan Singh) and mandatory death sentence (Mithu), among other cases. A\nperson cannot be deprived of life or personal liberty except in accordance with the\nprocedure established by law.\nArticle 14\n, as a guarantee against arbitrariness, infuses\nthe entirety of\nArticle 21.\nThe inter-relationship between the guarantee against\narbitrariness and the protection of life and personal liberty operates in a multi-faceted\nplane. First, it ensures that the procedure for deprivation must be fair, just and\nreasonable. Second,\nArticle 14\nimpacts both the procedure and the expression “law”.\n387\nIbid, at page 607\n240\nPART Q\nA law within the meaning of\nArticle 21\nmust be consistent with the norms of fairness\nwhich originate in\nArticle 14.\nAs a matter of principle, once\nArticle 14\nhas a connect\nwith\nArticle 21\n, norms of fairness and reasonableness would apply not only to the\nprocedure but to the law as well.\n166    Above all, it must be recognized that judicial review is a powerful guarantee\nagainst legislative encroachments on life and personal liberty. To cede this right would\ndilute the importance of the protection granted to life and personal liberty by the\nConstitution. Hence, while judicial review in constitutional challenges to the validity of\nlegislation is exercised with a conscious regard for the presumption of constitutionality\nand for the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial\ninstitutions, the constitutional power which is vested in the Court must be retained as\na vibrant means of protecting the lives and freedoms of individuals.\n167    The danger of construing this as an exercise of ‘substantive due process’ is that\nit results in the incorporation of a concept from the American Constitution which was\nconsciously not accepted when the Constitution was framed. Moreover, even in the\ncountry of its origin, substantive due process has led to vagaries of judicial\ninterpretation. Particularly having regard to the constitutional history surrounding the\ndeletion of that phrase in our Constitution, it would be inappropriate to equate the\njurisdiction of a Constitutional Court in India to entertain a substantive challenge to the\nvalidity of a law with the exercise of substantive due process under the US\nConstitution. Reference to substantive due process in some of          the judgments is\n241\nPART R\nessentially a reference to a substantive challenge to the validity of a law on the ground\nthat its substantive (as distinct from procedural) provisions violate the Constitution.\nR     Essential nature of privacy\n168   What, then, does privacy postulate? Privacy postulates the reservation of a\nprivate space for the individual, described as the right to be let alone. The concept is\nfounded on the autonomy of the individual. The ability of an individual to make choices\nlies at the core of the human personality. The notion of privacy enables the individual\nto assert and control the human element which is inseparable from the personality of\nthe individual. The inviolable nature of the human personality is manifested in the\nability to make decisions on matters intimate to human life. The autonomy of the\nindividual is associated over matters which can be kept private. These are concerns\nover which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The body and the mind are\ninseparable elements of the human personality. The integrity of the body and the\nsanctity of the mind can exist on the foundation that each individual possesses an\ninalienable ability and right to preserve a private space in which the human personality\ncan develop. Without the ability to make choices, the inviolability of the personality\nwould be in doubt. Recognizing a zone of privacy is but an acknowledgment that each\nindividual must be entitled to chart and pursue the course of development of\npersonality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human dignity itself. Thoughts and\nbehavioural patterns which are intimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of\nprivacy where one is free of social expectations. In that zone of privacy, an individual\n242\nPART R\nis not judged by others. Privacy enables each individual to take crucial decisions which\nfind expression in the human personality. It enables individuals to preserve their\nbeliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideas, ideologies, preferences and choices against\nsocietal demands of homogeneity. Privacy is an intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity,\nof the right of the individual to be different and to stand against the tide of conformity\nin creating a zone of solitude. Privacy protects the individual from the searching glare\nof publicity in matters which are personal to his or her life. Privacy attaches to the\nperson and not to the place where it is associated. Privacy constitutes the foundation\nof all liberty because it is in privacy that the individual can decide how liberty is best\nexercised. Individual dignity and privacy are inextricably linked in a pattern woven out\nof a thread of diversity into the fabric of a plural culture.\n169    Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both an\nintrinsic and instrumental value. As an intrinsic value, human dignity is an entitlement\nor a constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its instrumental facet, dignity and\nfreedom are inseparably inter-twined, each being a facilitative tool to achieve the\nother. The ability of the individual to protect a zone of privacy enables the realization\nof the full value of life and liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy is\na subset. All liberties may not be exercised in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only\nwithin a private space. Privacy enables the individual to retain the autonomy of the\nbody and mind. The autonomy of the individual is the ability to make decisions on\nvital matters of concern to life. Privacy has not been couched as an independent\nfundamental right. But that does not detract from the constitutional protection afforded\n243\nPART R\nto it, once the true nature of privacy and its relationship with those fundamental rights\nwhich are expressly protected is understood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of\nprotected freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee against arbitrary state\naction. It prevents the state from discriminating between individuals. The destruction\nby the state of a sanctified personal space whether of the body or of the mind is\nviolative of the guarantee against arbitrary state action. Privacy of the body entitles\nan individual to the integrity of the physical aspects of personhood. The intersection\nbetween one’s mental integrity and privacy entitles the individual to freedom of\nthought, the freedom to believe in what is right, and the freedom of self-determination.\nWhen these guarantees intersect with gender, they create a private space which\nprotects all those elements which are crucial to gender identity. The family, marriage,\nprocreation and sexual orientation are all integral to the dignity of the individual.\nAbove all, the privacy of the individual recognises an inviolable right to determine how\nfreedom shall be exercised.      An individual may perceive that the best form of\nexpression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a realm of privacy. An artist finds\nreflection of the soul in a creative endeavour. A writer expresses the outcome of a\nprocess of thought. A musician contemplates upon notes which musically lead to\nsilence. The silence, which lies within, reflects on the ability to choose how to convey\nthoughts and ideas or interact with others. These are crucial aspects of personhood.\nThe freedoms under\nArticle 19\ncan be fulfilled where the individual is entitled to decide\nupon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction with\nArticle 21\n, liberty enables the\nindividual to have a choice of preferences on various facets of life including what and\nhow one will eat, the way one will dress, the faith one will espouse and a myriad other\n244\nPART R\nmatters on which autonomy and self-determination require a choice to be made within\nthe privacy of the mind. The constitutional right to the freedom of religion under\nArticle\n25\nhas implicit within it the ability to choose a faith and the freedom to express or not\nexpress those choices to the world. These are some illustrations of the manner in\nwhich privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to the exercise of liberty.          The\nConstitution does not contain a separate article telling us that privacy has been\ndeclared to be a fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III with\nan alpha suffixed right of privacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting. Dignity cannot\nexist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and\nfreedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of\nthe sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the\nspectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and\nself-determination.\nPrivacy represents the core of the human personality and recognizes the ability of\neach individual to make choices and to take decisions governing matters intimate and\npersonal. Yet, it is necessary to acknowledge that individuals live in communities and\nwork in communities. Their personalities affect and, in turn are shaped by their social\nenvironment. The individual is not a hermit. The lives of individuals are as much a\nsocial phenomenon. In their interactions with others, individuals are constantly\nengaged in behavioural patterns and in relationships impacting on the rest of society.\nEqually, the life of the individual is being consistently shaped by cultural and social\nvalues imbibed from living in the community. This state of flux which represents a\n245\nPART S\nconstant evolution of individual personhood in the relationship with the rest of society\nprovides the rationale for reserving to the individual a zone of repose. The lives which\nindividuals lead as members of society engender a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nThe notion of a reasonable expectation of privacy has elements both of a subjective\nand objective nature. Privacy at a subjective level is a reflection of those areas where\nan individual desire to be left alone. On an objective plane, privacy is defined by those\nconstitutional values which shape the content of the protected zone where the\nindividual ought to be left alone. The notion that there must exist a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy ensures that while on the one hand, the individual has a\nprotected zone of privacy, yet on the other, the exercise of individual choices is subject\nto the rights of others to lead orderly lives. For instance, an individual who possesses\na plot of land may decide to build upon it subject to zoning regulations. If the building\nbye laws define the area upon which construction can be raised or the height of the\nboundary wall around the property, the right to privacy of the individual is conditioned\nby regulations designed to protect the interests of the community in planned spaces.\nHence while the individual is entitled to a zone of privacy, its extent is based not only\non the subjective expectation of the individual but on an objective principle which\ndefines a reasonable expectation.\nS     Informational privacy\n170   Ours is an age of information. Information is knowledge. The old adage that\n“knowledge is power” has stark implications for the position of the individual where\n246\nPART S\ndata is ubiquitous, an all-encompassing presence. Technology has made life\nfundamentally interconnected. The internet has become all pervasive as individuals\nspend more and more time online each day of their lives. Individuals connect with\nothers and use the internet as a means of communication. The internet is used to\ncarry on business and to buy goods and services. Individuals browse the web in\nsearch of information, to send e-mails, use instant messaging services and to\ndownload movies. Online purchases have become an efficient substitute for the daily\nvisit to the neighbouring store. Online banking has redefined relationships between\nbankers and customers. Online trading has created a new platform for the market in\nsecurities. Online music has refashioned the radio. Online books have opened up a\nnew universe for the bibliophile. The old-fashioned travel agent has been rendered\nredundant by web portals which provide everything from restaurants to rest houses,\nairline tickets to art galleries, museum tickets to music shows. These are but a few of\nthe reasons people access the internet each day of their lives. Yet every transaction\nof an individual user and every site that she visits, leaves electronic tracks generally\nwithout her knowledge.                These electronic tracks contain powerful means of\ninformation which provide knowledge of the sort of person that the user is and her\ninterests388.        Individually, these information silos may seem inconsequential. In\naggregation, they disclose the nature of the personality: food habits, language, health,\nhobbies, sexual preferences, friendships, ways of dress and political affiliation. In\n388\nSee Francois Nawrot, Katarzyna Syska and Przemyslaw Switalski, “Horizontal application of fundamental\nrights – Right to privacy on the internet”, 9th Annual European Constitutionalism Seminar (May 2010),\nUniversity of Warsaw, available at http://en.zpc.wpia.uw.edu.pl/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2010/04/9_Horizontal_Application_of_Fundamental_Rights.pdf\n247\nPART S\naggregation, information provides a picture of the being: of things which matter and\nthose that don’t, of things to be disclosed and those best hidden.\n171        Popular websites install cookie files by the user’s browser. Cookies can tag\nbrowsers for unique identified numbers, which allow them to recognise rapid users\nand secure information about online behaviour. Information, especially the browsing\nhistory of a user is utilised to create user profiles. The use of algorithms allows the\ncreation of profiles about internet users. Automated content analysis of e-mails allows\nfor reading of user e-mails. An e-mail can be analysed to deduce user interests and\nto target suitable advertisements to a user on the site of the window. The books which\nan individual purchases on-line provide footprints for targeted advertising of the same\ngenre. Whether an airline ticket has been purchased on economy or business class,\nprovides vital information about employment profile or spending capacity. Taxi rides\nbooked on-line to shopping malls provide a profile of customer preferences. A woman\nwho purchases pregnancy related medicines on-line would be in line to receive\nadvertisements for baby products. Lives are open to electronic scrutiny. To put it\nmildly, privacy concerns are seriously an issue in the age of information.\n172        A Press Note released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on 3 July,\n2017389 is indicative of the prevalence of telecom services in India as on 31 December,\n2016. The total number of subscribers stood at 1151.78 million, reflecting a 11.13\n389\nPress Release 45/2017, available at http://trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/PR_No.45of2017.pdf\n248\nPART S\npercent change over the previous year. There were 683.14 million urban subscribers\nand 468.64 million rural subscribers. The total number of internet subscribers stood\nat 391.50 million reflecting an 18.04 per cent change over the previous quarter.\n236.09 million were broadband subscribers. 370 million is the figure of wireless\ninternet subscribers. The total internet subscribers per 100 population stood at 30.56;\nurban internet subscribers were 68.86 per 100 population; and rural internet\nsubscribers being 13.08. The figures only increase.\n173     The age of information has resulted in complex issues for informational privacy.\nThese issues arise from the nature of information itself. Information has three facets:\nit is nonrivalrous, invisible and recombinant390. Information is nonrivalrous in the\nsense that there can be simultaneous users of the good – use of a piece of information\nby one person does not make it less available to another. Secondly, invasions of data\nprivacy are difficult to detect because they can be invisible. Information can be\naccessed, stored and disseminated without notice. Its ability to travel at the speed of\nlight enhances the invisibility of access to data, “information collection can be the\nswiftest theft of all”391. Thirdly, information is recombinant in the sense that data output\ncan be used as an input to generate more data output.\n390\nChristina P. Moniodis, “Moving from Nixon to NASA: Privacy ‘s Second Strand- A Right to Informational\nPrivacy”, Yale Journal of Law and Technology (2012), Vol. 15 (1), at page 153\n391\nIbid\n249\nPART S\n174     Data Mining processes together with knowledge discovery can be combined to\ncreate facts about individuals. Metadata and the internet of things have the ability to\nredefine human existence in ways which are yet fully to be perceived. This, as\nChristina Moniodis states in her illuminating article results in the creation of new\nknowledge about individuals; something which even she or he did not possess. This\nposes serious issues for the Court. In an age of rapidly evolving technology it is\nimpossible for a judge to conceive of all the possible uses of information or its\nconsequences:\n“…The creation of new knowledge complicates data privacy law as\nit involves information the individual did not possess and could not\ndisclose, knowingly or otherwise. In addition, as our state becomes\nan “information state” through increasing reliance on information –\nsuch that information is described as the “lifeblood that sustains\npolitical, social, and business decisions. It becomes impossible to\nconceptualize all of the possible uses of information and resulting\nharms. Such a situation poses a challenge for courts who are\neffectively asked to anticipate and remedy invisible, evolving\nharms.” 392\nThe contemporary age has been aptly regarded as “an era of ubiquitous dataveillance,\nor the systematic monitoring of citizen’s communications or actions through the use\nof information technology”393. It is also an age of “big data” or the collection of data\nsets. These data sets are capable of being searched; they have linkages with other\ndata sets; and are marked by their exhaustive scope and the permanency of\ncollection.394 The challenges which big data poses to privacy interests emanate from\n392\nIbid, at page 154\n393\nYvonne McDermott, “Conceptualizing the right to data protection in an era of Big Data”, Big Data and Society\n(2017), at page 1\n394\nIbid, at pages 1 and 4\n250\nPART S\nState and non-State entities. Users of wearable devices and social media networks\nmay not conceive of themselves as having volunteered data but their activities of use\nand engagement result in the generation of vast amounts of data about individual\nlifestyles, choices and preferences. Yvonne McDermott speaks about the quantified\nself in eloquent terms:\n“…The rise in the so-called ‘quantified self’, or the self-tracking of\nbiological, environmental, physical, or behavioural information\nthrough tracking devices, Internet-of-things devices, social network\ndata and other means (?Swan.2013) may result in information\nbeing gathered not just about the individual user, but about people\naround them as well. Thus, a solely consent-based model does not\nentirely ensure the protection of one’s data, especially when data\ncollected for one purpose can be repurposed for another.”395\n175     Daniel J Solove deals with the problem of “aggregation”. Businesses and\ngovernments often aggregate a variety of information fragments, including pieces of\ninformation which may not be viewed as private in isolation to create a detailed portrait\nof personalities and behaviour of individuals.396 Yet, it is now a universally accepted\nfact that information and data flow are “increasingly central to social and economic\nordering”397. Individuals are identified with reference to tax records, voting eligibility,\nand government-provided entitlements. There is what is now described as “‘veillant\npanoptic assemblage’, where data gathered through the ordinary citizen’s veillance\n395\nIbid, at page 4\n396\nChristina P. Moniodis, “Moving from Nixon to NASA: Privacy ‘s Second Strand- A Right to Informational\nPrivacy”, Yale Journal of Law and Technology (2012), Vol. 15 (1), at page 159. The article attributes Daniel\nSolove’s work on privacy as- Daniel J. Solove, Understanding Privacy 70 (2008).\n397\nIbid, at page 156\n251\nPART S\npractices finds its way to state surveillance mechanisms, through the corporations that\nhold that data”398.\n176        The balance between data regulation and individual privacy raises complex\nissues requiring delicate balances to be drawn between the legitimate concerns of the\nState on one hand and individual interest in the protection of privacy on the other.\n177        The sphere of privacy stretches at one end to those intimate matters to which\na reasonable expectation of privacy may attach. It expresses a right to be left alone.\nA broader connotation which has emerged in academic literature of a comparatively\nrecent origin is related to the protection of one’s identity. Data protection relates\nclosely with the latter sphere. Data such as medical information would be a category\nto which a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches. There may be other data which\nfalls outside the reasonable expectation paradigm. Apart from safeguarding privacy,\ndata protection regimes seek to protect the autonomy of the individual. This is evident\nfrom the emphasis in the European data protection regime on the centrality of consent.\nRelated to the issue of consent is the requirement of transparency which requires a\ndisclosure by the data recipient of information pertaining to data transfer and use.\n178        Another aspect which data protection regimes seek to safeguard is the principle\nof non-discrimination which ensures that the collection of data should be carried out\n398\nYvonne McDermott, “Conceptualizing the right to data protection in an era of Big Data”, Big Data and Society\n(2017), at page 4.\n252\nPART S\nin a manner which does not discriminate on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political\nor religious beliefs, genetic or health status or sexual orientation.\n179     Formulation of a regime for data protection is a complex exercise which needs\nto be undertaken by the State after a careful balancing of the requirements of privacy\ncoupled with other values which the protection of data sub-serves together with the\nlegitimate concerns of the State. One of the chief concerns which the formulation of\na data protection regime has to take into account is that while the web is a source of\nlawful activity-both personal and commercial, concerns of national security intervene\nsince the seamless structure of the web can be exploited by terrorists to wreak havoc\nand destruction on civilised societies. Cyber attacks can threaten financial systems.\nRichard A Posner, in an illuminating article, has observed:\n“Privacy is the terrorist’s best friend, and the terrorist’s privacy has\nbeen enhanced by the same technological developments that have\nboth made data mining feasible and elicited vast quantities of\npersonal information from innocents: the internet, with its\nanonymity, and the secure encryption of digitized data which, when\ncombined with that anonymity, make the internet a powerful tool of\nconspiracy. The government has a compelling need to exploit\ndigitization in defense of national security…”399\nPosner notes that while “people value their informational privacy”, yet “they surrender\nit at the drop of a hat” by readily sharing personal data in the course of simple daily\ntransactions. The paradox, he observes, can be resolved by noting that as long as\n399\nRichard A. Posner, “Privacy, Surveillance, and Law”, The University of Chicago Law Review (2008), Vol.75,\nat page 251\n253\nPART S\npeople do not expect that the details of their health, intimacies and finances among\nothers will be used to harm them in interaction with other people, they are content to\nreveal those details when they derive benefits from the revelation. 400 As long as\nintelligence personnel can be trusted to use the knowledge gained only for the\ndefence of the nation, “the public will be compensated for the costs of diminished\nprivacy in increased security from terrorist attacks”401. Posner’s formulation would\nindicate that the State does have a legitimate interest when it monitors the web to\nsecure the nation against cyber attacks and the activities of terrorists.\n180          While it intervenes to protect legitimate state interests, the state must\nnevertheless put into place a robust regime that ensures the fulfilment of a three-fold\nrequirement. These three requirements apply to all restraints on privacy (not just\ninformational privacy). They emanate from the procedural and content-based\nmandate of\nArticle 21.\nThe first requirement that there must be a law in existence to\njustify an encroachment on privacy is an express requirement of\nArticle 21.\nFor, no\nperson can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with the\nprocedure established by law. The existence of law is an essential requirement.\nSecond, the requirement of a need, in terms of a legitimate state aim, ensures that\nthe nature and content of the law which imposes the restriction falls within the zone of\nreasonableness mandated by\nArticle 14\n, which is a guarantee against arbitrary state\naction. The pursuit of a legitimate state aim ensures that the law does not suffer from\n400\nIbid\n401\nIbid\n254\nPART S\nmanifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a postulate, involves a value judgment. Judicial\nreview does not re-appreciate or second guess the value judgment of the legislature\nbut is for deciding whether the aim which is sought to be pursued suffers from palpable\nor manifest arbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the means which are\nadopted by the legislature are proportional to the object and needs sought to be\nfulfilled by the law. Proportionality is an essential facet of the guarantee against\narbitrary state action because it ensures that the nature and quality of the\nencroachment on the right is not disproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence,\nthe three-fold requirement for a valid law arises out of the mutual inter-dependence\nbetween the fundamental guarantees against arbitrariness on the one hand and the\nprotection of life and personal liberty, on the other. The right to privacy, which is an\nintrinsic part of the right to life and liberty, and the freedoms embodied in Part III is\nsubject to the same restraints which apply to those freedoms.\n181   Apart from national security, the state may have justifiable reasons for the\ncollection and storage of data. In a social welfare state, the government embarks\nupon programmes which provide benefits to impoverished and marginalised sections\nof society. There is a vital state interest in ensuring that scarce public resources are\nnot dissipated by the diversion of resources to persons who do not qualify as\nrecipients. Allocation of resources for human development is coupled with a legitimate\nconcern that the utilisation of resources should not be siphoned away for extraneous\npurposes. Data mining with the object of ensuring that resources are properly\ndeployed to legitimate beneficiaries is a valid ground for the state to insist on the\n255\nPART S\ncollection of authentic data. But, the data which the state has collected has to be\nutilised for legitimate purposes of the state and ought not to be utilised unauthorizedly\nfor extraneous purposes. This will ensure that the legitimate concerns of the state are\nduly safeguarded while, at the same time, protecting privacy concerns. Prevention\nand investigation of crime and protection of the revenue are among the legitimate\naims of the state. Digital platforms are a vital tool of ensuring good governance in a\nsocial welfare state. Information technology – legitimately deployed is a powerful\nenabler in the spread of innovation and knowledge.\n182       A distinction has been made in contemporary literature between anonymity on\none hand and privacy on the other.402 Both anonymity and privacy prevent others from\ngaining access to pieces of personal information yet they do so in opposite ways.\nPrivacy involves hiding information whereas anonymity involves hiding what makes it\npersonal. An unauthorised parting of the medical records of an individual which have\nbeen furnished to a hospital will amount to an invasion of privacy. On the other hand,\nthe state may assert a legitimate interest in analysing data borne from hospital records\nto understand and deal with a public health epidemic such as malaria or dengue to\nobviate a serious impact on the population. If the State preserves the anonymity of the\nindividual it could legitimately assert a valid state interest in the preservation of public\nhealth to design appropriate policy interventions on the basis of the data available to\nit.\n402\nSee in this connection, Jeffrey M. Skopek, “Reasonable Expectations of Anonymity”, Virginia Law Review\n(2015), Vol.101, at pages 691-762\n256\nPART S\n183    Privacy has been held to be an intrinsic element of the right to life and personal\nliberty under\nArticle 21\nand as a constitutional value which is embodied in the\nfundamental freedoms embedded in Part III of the Constitution. Like the right to life\nand liberty, privacy is not absolute. The limitations which operate on the right to life\nand personal liberty would operate on the right to privacy.                  Any curtailment or\ndeprivation of that right would have to take place under a regime of law. The procedure\nestablished by law must be fair, just and reasonable. The law which provides for the\ncurtailment of the right must also be subject to constitutional safeguards.\n184    The Union government constituted a Group of Experts on privacy under the\nauspices of the erstwhile Planning Commission. The Expert Group in its Report403\n(dated 16 October 2012) proposed a framework for the protection of privacy concerns\nwhich, it was expected, would serve as a conceptual foundation for legislation\nprotecting privacy. The framework suggested by the expert group was based on five\nsalient features: (i) Technological neutrality and interoperability with international\nstandards; (ii) Multi-Dimensional privacy; (iii) Horizontal applicability to state and non-\nstate entities; (iv) Conformity with privacy principles; and (v) A co-regulatory\nenforcement regime. After reviewing international best practices, the Expert Group\nproposed nine privacy principles. They are:\n403\n“Report of the Group of Experts on Privacy” (16 October, 2012), Government of India, available at\nhttp://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_privacy.pdf\n257\nPART S\n(i) Notice: A data controller shall give simple-to-understand notice of its information\npractices to all individuals in clear and concise language, before personal\ninformation is collected;\n(ii) Choice and Consent: A data controller shall give individuals choices (opt-in/opt-\nout) with regard to providing their personal information, and take individual\nconsent only after providing notice of its information practices;\n(iii) Collection Limitation: A data controller shall only collect personal information\nfrom data subjects as is necessary for the purposes identified for such collection,\nregarding which notice has been provided and consent of the individual taken.\nSuch collection shall be through lawful and fair means;\n(iv) Purpose Limitation: Personal data collected and processed by data controllers\nshould be adequate and relevant to the purposes for which it is processed.

Data\nretention mandates by the government should be in compliance with the National\nPrivacy Principles;\n(v) Access and Correction: Individuals shall have access to personal information\nabout them held by a data controller; shall be able to seek correction,\namendments, or deletion of such information where it is inaccurate; be able to\nconfirm that a data controller holds or is processing information about them; be\n258\nPART S\nable to obtain from the data controller a copy of the personal data. Access and\ncorrection to personal information may not be given by the data controller if it is\nnot, despite best efforts, possible to do so without affecting the privacy rights of\nanother person, unless that person has explicitly consented to disclosure;\n(vi) Disclosure of Information: A data controller shall not disclose personal information\nto third parties, except after providing notice and seeking informed consent from\nthe individual for such disclosure.

The terms of reference of the Committee are :\na)      To study various issues relating to data protection in India;\nb)      To make specific suggestions for consideration of the Central Government\non principles to be considered for data protection in India and suggest a\ndraft data protection bill.\nSince the government has initiated the process of reviewing the entire area of data\nprotection, it would be appropriate to leave the matter for expert determination so that\na robust regime for the protection of data is put into place. We expect that the Union\ngovernment shall follow up on its decision by taking all necessary and proper steps.\nT        Our Conclusions\n1 The judgment in M P Sharma holds essentially that in the absence of a provision\nsimilar to the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, the right to privacy cannot\n260\nPART T\nbe read into the provisions of\nArticle 20 (3)\nof the Indian Constitution. The judgment\ndoes not specifically adjudicate on whether a right to privacy would arise from any\nof the other provisions of the rights guaranteed by Part III including\nArticle 21\nand\nArticle 19.\nThe observation that privacy is not a right guaranteed by the Indian\nConstitution is not reflective of the correct position. M P Sharma is overruled to the\nextent to which it indicates to the contrary.\n2 Kharak Singh has correctly held that the content of the expression ‘life’ under\nArticle 21\nmeans not merely the right to a person’s “animal existence” and that the\nexpression ‘personal liberty’ is a guarantee against invasion into the sanctity of a\nperson’s home or an intrusion into personal security. Kharak Singh also correctly\nlaid down that the dignity of the individual must lend content to the meaning of\n‘personal liberty’. The first part of the decision in Kharak Singh which invalidated\ndomiciliary visits at night on the ground that they violated ordered liberty is an\nimplicit recognition of the right to privacy. The second part of the decision,\nhowever, which holds that the right to privacy is not a guaranteed right under our\nConstitution, is not reflective of the correct position. Similarly, Kharak Singh’s\nreliance upon the decision of the majority in Gopalan is not reflective of the correct\nposition in view of the decisions in Cooper and in Maneka. Kharak Singh to the\nextent that it holds that the right to privacy is not protected under the Indian\nConstitution is overruled.\n261\nPART T\n3 (A) Life and personal liberty are inalienable rights. These are rights which are\ninseparable from a dignified human existence.        The dignity of the individual,\nequality between human beings and the quest for liberty are the foundational pillars\nof the Indian Constitution;\n(B) Life and personal liberty are not creations of the Constitution. These rights are\nrecognised by the Constitution as inhering in each individual as an intrinsic and\ninseparable part of the human element which dwells within;\n(C) Privacy is a constitutionally protected right which emerges primarily from the\nguarantee of life and personal liberty in\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. Elements of\nprivacy also arise in varying contexts from the other facets of freedom and dignity\nrecognised and guaranteed by the fundamental rights contained in Part III;\n(D) Judicial recognition of the existence of a constitutional right of privacy is not an\nexercise in the nature of amending the Constitution nor is the Court embarking on\na constitutional function of that nature which is entrusted to Parliament;\n(E) Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity. Privacy has both a normative\nand descriptive function. At a normative level privacy sub-serves those eternal\nvalues upon which the guarantees of life, liberty and freedom are founded. At a\ndescriptive level, privacy postulates a bundle of entitlements and interests which\nlie at the foundation of ordered liberty;\n262\nPART T\n(F) Privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of\nfamily life, marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also\nconnotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards individual autonomy and\nrecognises the ability of the individual to control vital aspects of his or her life.\nPersonal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy. Privacy protects\nheterogeneity and recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture. While the\nlegitimate expectation of privacy may vary from the intimate zone to the private\nzone and from the private to the public arenas, it is important to underscore that\nprivacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is in a public place.\nPrivacy attaches to the person since it is an essential facet of the dignity of the\nhuman being;\n(G) This Court has not embarked upon an exhaustive enumeration or a catalogue of\nentitlements or interests comprised in the right to privacy. The Constitution must\nevolve with the felt necessities of time to meet the challenges thrown up in a\ndemocratic order governed by the rule of law. The meaning of the Constitution\ncannot be frozen on the perspectives present when it was adopted. Technological\nchange has given rise to concerns which were not present seven decades ago\nand the rapid growth of technology may render obsolescent many notions of the\npresent. Hence the interpretation of the Constitution must be resilient and flexible\nto allow future generations to adapt its content bearing in mind its basic or\nessential features;\n263\nPART T\n(H) Like other rights which form part of the fundamental freedoms protected by Part\nIII, including the right to life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21\n, privacy is not an\nabsolute right. A law which encroaches upon privacy will have to withstand the\ntouchstone of permissible restrictions on fundamental rights. In the context of\nArticle 21\nan invasion of privacy must be justified on the basis of a law which\nstipulates a procedure which is fair, just and reasonable. The law must also be\nvalid with reference to the encroachment on life and personal liberty under Article\n21. An invasion of life or personal liberty must meet the three-fold requirement of\n(i) legality, which postulates the existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a\nlegitimate state aim; and (iii) proportionality which ensures a rational nexus\nbetween the objects and the means adopted to achieve them; and\n(I) Privacy has both positive and negative content. The negative content restrains the\nstate from committing an intrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its\npositive content imposes an obligation on the state to take all necessary measures\nto protect the privacy of the individual.\n4 Decisions rendered by this Court subsequent to Kharak Singh, upholding the right\nto privacy would be read subject to the above principles.\n5 Informational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy. The dangers to privacy in\nan age of information can originate not only from the state but from non-state actors\nas well. We commend to the Union Government the need to examine and put into\nplace a robust regime for data protection. The creation of such a regime requires\n264\nPART T\na careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate\nconcerns of the state. The legitimate aims of the state would include for instance\nprotecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging\ninnovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social\nwelfare benefits. These are matters of policy to be considered by the Union\ngovernment while designing a carefully structured regime for the protection of the\ndata. Since the Union government has informed the Court that it has constituted a\nCommittee chaired by Hon’ble Shri Justice B N Srikrishna, former Judge of this\nCourt, for that purpose, the matter shall be dealt with appropriately by the Union\ngovernment having due regard to what has been set out in this judgment.\n6 The reference is answered in the above terms.\n...........................................CJI\n[JAGDISH SINGH KHEHAR]\n..............................................J\n[R K AGRAWAL]\n..............................................J\n[Dr D Y CHANDRACHUD]\n265\nPART T\n.............................................J\n[S ABDUL NAZEER]\nNew Delhi;\nDated : 24, August 2017\n266\nReportable\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION\nWRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO.494 OF 2012\nJustice K.S.

I have had the advantage of reading the opinion of my learned\nbrothers Justice Nariman and Justice Chandrachud. Both of them\nin depth dealt with various questions that are required to be\nexamined by this Bench, to answer the reference.      The factual\nbackground in which these questions arise and the history of the\n2\ninstant litigation is set out in the judgments of my learned brothers.\nThere is no need to repeat. Having regard to the importance of the\nmatter, I am unable to desist recording few of my views regarding\nthe various questions which were debated in this matter.\n2.  The following three questions, in my opinion, constitute the\ncrux of the enquiry;\n(i)     Is there any Fundamental Right to Privacy under the\nConstitution of India?\n(ii)    If it exists, where is it located?\n(iii)   What are the contours of such Right?\n3.      These questions arose because Union of India and some of the\nrespondents took a stand that, in view of two larger bench\njudgments of this Court1, no fundamental right of privacy is\nguaranteed under the Constitution.\n4.      Therefore, at the outset, it is necessary to examine whether it\nis the ratio decidendi of M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh that under\nour Constitution there is no Fundamental Right of Privacy; and if\nthat be indeed the ratio of either of the two rulings whether they\nwere rightly decided? The issue which fell for the consideration of\n1\nM.P. Sharma & Others v. Satish Chandra & Others\n, AIR 1954 SC 300 and Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. &\nOthers, AIR 1963 SC 1295, (both decisions of Constitution Bench of Eight and Six Judges respectively).\n3\nthis Court in M.P. Sharma was – whether seizure of documents from\nthe custody of a person accused of an offence would amount to\n“testimonial compulsion” prohibited under\nArticle 20(3)\nof our\nConstitution?\n5.       The rule against the “testimonial compulsion” is contained in\nArticle 20(3)2\nof our Constitution.                                 The expression “testimonial\ncompulsion” is not found in that provision. The mandate contained\nin\nArticle 20(3)\ncame to be described as the rule against testimonial\ncompulsion. The rule against self-incrimination owes its origin to\nthe revulsion against the inquisitorial methods adopted by the Star\nChamber of England3 and the same was incorporated in the Fifth\nAmendment of the American Constitution.4\n2\n“Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India: “No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness\nagainst himself.”\n3\n“In English law, this principle of protection against self-incrimination had a historical origin. It resulted from a\nfeeling of revulsion against the inquisitorial methods adopted and the barbarous sentences imposed, by the Court of\nStar Chamber, in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction. This came to a head in the case of John Lilburn, 3 State\nTrials 1315, which brought about the abolition of the Star Chamber and the firm recognition of the principle that the\naccused should not be put on oath and that no evidence should be taken from him. This principle, in course of time,\ndeveloped into its logical extensions, by way of privilege of witnesses against self-incrimination, when called for\ngiving oral testimony or for production of documents. A change was introduced by the Criminal Evidence Act of\n1898 by making an accused a competent witness on his own behalf, if he applied for it. But so far as the oral\ntestimony of witnesses and the production of documents are concerned, the protection against self-incrimination\ncontinued as before. (See Phipson on Evidence, 9th Edition, pages 215 and 474).\nThese principles, as they were before the statutory change in 1898, were carried into the American legal system\nand became part of its common law. (See Wigmore on Evidence, Vol.VIII, pages 301 to 303). This was later on\nincorporated into their Constitution by virtue of the Fifth Amendment thereof.”\n4\n“Amendment V of the American Constitution: \"No person ……..shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a\nwitness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law …\"\n4\n6.      Does the rule against “testimonial compulsion”, entrenched as\na fundamental right under our Constitution create a right of\nprivacy? - is a question not examined in M.P. Sharma.                                                 It was\nargued in M.P. Sharma “that a search to obtain documents for investigation\ninto an offence is a compulsory procuring of incriminatory evidence from the\naccused himself and is, therefore, hit by\nArticle 20(3)\n…” by necessary\nimplication flowing from “certain canons of liberal construction”.                               Originally\nthe rule was invoked only against oral evidence.                                    But the judgment\nin Boyd v. United States5, extended the rule even to documents\nprocured during the course of a constitutionally impermissible\nsearch6.\nThis Court refused to read the principle enunciated in Boyd\ninto\nArticle 20(3)\non the ground: “we have nothing in our Constitution\ncorresponding to the Fourth Amendment”.\nThis Court held that the power of search and seizure is “an\noverriding power of the State for the protection of social security”. It further\nheld that such power (1) “is necessarily regulated by law”; and (2) Since the\nConstitution makers have not made any provision “analogous to the\n5\n116 US 616\n6\nA search in violation of the safeguards provided under the Fourth Amendment – “The right of the people to be\nsecure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be\nviolated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly\ndescribing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\n5\nAmerican Fourth Amendment”, such a requirement could not be read into\nArticle 20(3).\nIt was in the said context that this Court referred to the right\nof privacy:\n“A power of search and seizure is in any system of jurisprudence an\noverriding power of the State for the protection of social security and\nthat power is necessarily regulated by law. When the Constitution\nmakers have thought fit not to subject such regulation to\nConstitutional limitations by recognition of a fundamental right to\nprivacy, analogous to the American Fourth Amendment, we have\nno justification to import it, into a totally different fundamental\nright, by some process of strained construction.”\n7.   I see no warrant for a conclusion (which is absolute) that their\nlordships held that there is no right of privacy under our\nConstitution. All that, in my opinion, their Lordships meant to say\nwas that contents of the U.S. Fourth Amendment cannot be\nimported into our Constitution, while interpreting\nArticle 20(3).\nThat is the boundary of M.P. Singh’s ratio. Such a conclusion, in\nmy opinion, requires a further examination in an appropriate\ncase since it is now too well settled that the text                   of       the\nConstitution is only the primary source for understanding the\nConstitution and the silences of the Constitution are also to\nbe ascertained to understand the Constitution. Even according to\nthe American Supreme Court, the Fourth Amendment is not the\n6\nsole repository of the right to privacy7. Therefore, values other than\nthose informing the Fourth Amendment can ground a right of\nprivacy if such values are a part of the Indian Constitutional\nframework, and M.P. Sharma does not contemplate this possibility\nnor was there an occasion, therefore as the case was concerned\nwith\nArticle         20(3).\nEspecially            so      as       the       Gopalan           era\ncompartmentalization ruled the roost during the time of the M.P.\nSharma ruling and there was no Maneka Gandhi interpretation of\nPart III as a cohesive and fused code as is presently.\nWhether the right of privacy is implied in any other\nfundamental right guaranteed under\nArticles 21\n, 14\n, 19\nor 25 etc.\nwas not examined in M.P Sharma.                                      The question whether a\nfundamental right of privacy is implied from these Articles, is\ntherefore, res integra and M.P. Sharma is no authority on that\naspect. I am, therefore, of the opinion that M.P. Sharma is not an\nauthority for an absolute proposition that there is no right of\nprivacy under our Constitution; and such is not the ratio of that\njudgment.\n7\nIn Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 US 479, Douglas, J who delivered the opinion of the Court opined that the I, II,\nIV, V and IX Amendments creates zones of privacy. Goldberg, J. opined that even the XIV Amendment creates a\nzone of privacy. This undoubtedly grounds a right of privacy beyond the IV amendment. Even after Griswold, other\ncases like Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) have made this point amply clear by sourcing a constitutional right of\nprivacy from sources other than the IV amendment.\n7\n8.     The issue in Kharak Singh was the constitutionality of police\nregulations of UP which inter alia provided for ‘surveillance’ of\ncertain categories            of people         by various            methods, such as,\ndomiciliary visits at night’, ‘verification of movements and absences’\netc.    Two judgments (4:2) were delivered.                      Majority took the view\nthat the impugned regulation insofar as it provided for ‘domiciliary\nvisits at night’ is unconstitutional whereas the minority opined the\nimpugned regulation is in its entirety unconstitutional.\nThe Court was invited to examine whether the impugned\nregulations violated the fundamental rights of Kharak Singh\nguaranteed under\nArticles 21\nand\n19(1)(d).\nIn that context, this\nCourt examined the scope of the expression ‘personal liberty’\nguaranteed under\nArticle 21.\nMajority declared that the expression\n“personal liberty” occurring under\nArticle 21:\n“is used in the Article as\ncompendious term to include within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the\n“personal liberties” of man other than those dealt with in several clauses of\nArticle 19(1)\n”. In\nother words, while\nArticle 19(1)\ndeals with particular species or attributes of that freedom,\npersonal liberty in\nArticle 21\ntakes in and comprises the residue.”\n9.     The      Kharak Singh majority opined                          that the   impugned\nregulation insofar as it provided for ‘domiciliary visits’ is plainly\n8\n“violative of Article 21”. The majority took note of the American decision\nin Wolf v. Colorado, 338 US 25 wherein it was held that State lacks\nthe authority to sanction “incursion into privacy” of citizens.      Such a\npower would run counter to the guarantee of the Fourteenth\nAmendment8 and against the “very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty”.9 The\nmajority judgment in Kharak Singh noticed that the conclusion\nrecorded in Wolf v. Colorado is based on the prohibition contained\nin the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and a\ncorresponding provision is absent in our Constitution. Nonetheless,\ntheir Lordships concluded that the impugned regulation insofar as\nit sanctioned domiciliary visits is plainly violative of\nArticle 21.\nFor\nthis conclusion, their Lordships relied upon the English Common\nLaw maxim that “every man's house is his castle\"10. In substance\ndomiciliary visits violate liberty guaranteed under\nArticle 21.\nThe twin conclusions recorded, viz., that Article 21 takes\nwithin its sweep various rights other than mere freedom from\nphysical restraint; and domiciliary visits by police violate the right\nof Kharak Singh guaranteed under Article 21, are a great leap from\n8\nFrankfurter, J.\n9\nMurphy, J.\n10\nSee (1604) 5 Coke 91 – Semayne’s case\n9\nthe law declared by this Court in Gopalan11 - much before R.C.\nCooper12 and Maneka Gandhi13 cases. The logical inconsistency in\nthe judgment is that while on the one hand their Lordships opined\nthat the maxim “every man’s house is his castle” is a part of the liberty\nunder\nArticle 21\n, concluded on the other, that absence of a\nprovision akin to the U.S. Fourth Amendment would negate the\nclaim to the right of privacy.                         Both statements are logically\ninconsistent.          In the earlier part of the judgment their Lordships\nnoticed14 that it is the English Common Law which formed the basis\nof the U.S. Fourth Amendment and is required to be read into\nArticle 21;\nbut nevertheless declined to read the right of privacy into\nArticle 21.\nThis is the incongruence.\n10.\nInterestingly as observed by Justice Nariman, when it came to\nthe constitutionality of the other provisions impugned in Kharak\nSingh, their Lordships held that such provisions are not violative of\nArticle      21\nsince       there      is     no   right   to   privacy   under   our\n11\nA.K. Gopalan Vs. State of Madras\nAIR 1950 SC 27\n12\nRC Cooper Vs. Union of India (\n1970) 1 SCC 248\n13\nManeka Gandhi Vs. Union of India\n(1978) 1 SCC 248\n14\nSee F/N 3 (supra)\n10\nConstitution15. I completely endorse the view of my learned brother\nNariman in this regard.\n11. I now proceed to examine the salient features of the minority\nview.\n(i)     Disagreement with the majority on the conclusion\nthat\nArticle 21\ncontains those aspects of personal\nliberty excluding those enumerated under\nArticle\n19(1);\n(ii)    after noticing that Gopalan held that the expression\n“personal liberty” occurring under\nArticle 21\nis only\nthe antithesis of physical restraint or coercion,\nopined that in modern world coercion need not only\nbe physical coercion but can also take the form of\npsychological coercion;\n(iii)   “further the right to personal liberty takes in not only a right to be free\nfrom restrictions placed on his movements, but also free from\nencroachments on his private life.”;\n15\nNor do we consider that\nArticle 21\nhas any relevance in the context as was sought to be suggested by learned\nCounsel for the petitioner. As already pointed out, the right of privacy is not a guaranteed right under our\nConstitution and therefore the attempt to ascertain the movements of an individual which is merely a manner in\nwhich privacy is invaded is not an infringement of a fundamental right guaranteed by Part III.\n11\n(iv)     Though “our Constitution does not expressly declare the right to\nprivacy as a fundamental right”, “the said right is an essential\ningredient of personal liberty”.\nIn substance Kharak Singh declared that the expression\n“personal liberty” in\nArticle 21\ntakes within its sweep a bundle of\nrights.           Both the majority and minority are ad idem on that\nconclusion. The only point of divergence is that the minority opined\nthat one of the rights in the bundle is the right of privacy. In the\nopinion of the minority the right to privacy is “an essential ingredient of\npersonal liberty”. Whereas the majority opined that “the right of privacy\nis not a guaranteed right under our Constitution”, and therefore the same\ncannot be read into\nArticle 21.16\n12. I am of the opinion that the approach adopted by the majority\nis illogical and against settled principles of interpretation of even an\nordinary statute; and wholly unwarranted in the context of\nconstitutional interpretation. If a right is recognised by the express\nlanguage of a statute, no question of implying such a right from\n16\nKharak Singh v. The State of U.P. & Others\n, (1962) 1 SCR 332 at page 351\n“… Nor do we consider that\nArticle 21\nhas any relevance in the context as was sought to be suggested by\nlearned Counsel for the petitioner. As already pointed out, the right of privacy is not a guaranteed right\nunder our Constitution and therefore the attempt to ascertain the movements of an individual which is\nmerely a manner in which privacy is invaded is not an infringement of a fundamental right guaranteed by\nPart III.”\n12\nsome provision of such statute arises.                                      Implications are logical\nextensions of stipulations in the express language of the statute\nand arise only when a statute is silent on certain aspects.\nImplications are the product of the interpretative process, of\nsilences of a Statute.                       It is by now well settled that there are\nimplications even in written Constitutions.17 The scope and\namplitude of implications are to be ascertained in the light of the\nscheme and purpose sought to be achieved by a statute.                                                     The\npurpose of the statute is to be ascertained from the overall scheme\nof the statute. Constitution is the fundamental law adumbrating\nthe powers and duties of the various organs of the State and rights\nof the SUBJECTS18 and limitations thereon, of the State.                                               In my\nopinion, provisions purportedly conferring power on the State are in\nfact limitations on the State power to infringe on the liberty of\nSUBJECTS.\nIn the context of the interpretation of a Constitution\n17\n(1947) 74 CLR 31 –\nThe Melbourne Corporation v. The Commonwealth\n“ ... Thus, the purpose of the Constitution, and the scheme by which it is intended to be given effect,\nnecessarily give rise to implications as to the manner in which the Commonwealth and the States\nrespectively may exercise their powers, vis-à-vis each other.”\nAlso see:\nHis Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala & Another\n, (1973) 4 SCC\n225\n18\nCitizens and non-citizens who are amenable to the Constitutional authority of the State\n13\nthe intensity of analysis to ascertain the purpose is required to be\nmore profound.19\nThe implications arising from the scheme of the Constitution\nare “Constitution’s dark matter” and are as important as the\nexpress stipulations in its text.                               The principle\nlaid down by\nthis\nCourt in Kesvananda20, that the basic structure of the Constitution\ncannot be abrogated is the most outstanding and brilliant\nexposition of the ‘dark matter’ and is a part of our Constitution,\nthough there is nothing in the text suggesting that principle. The\n19\nTwo categories of Constitutional interpretation - textualist and living constitutionalist approach are well known.\nThe former, as is illustrated by the\nGopalan\ncase, focuses on the text at hand i.e. the language of the relevant\nprovision. The text and the intent of the original framers are determinative under the textualist approach. The living\nconstitutionalist approach, while acknowledging the importance of the text, takes into account a variety of factors as\naids to interpret the text. Depending on the nature of factor used, academics have added further nuance to the this\napproach of interpretation (For instance, in his book titled ‘Constitutional Interpretation’ (which builds on his earlier\nwork titled ‘Constitutional Fate’), Philip Bobbitt categorizes the six approaches to interpretation of Constitutions as\nhistorical, textual, prudential, doctrinal, structural, and ethical. The latter four approaches treat the text as less\ndeterminative than the former two approaches).\nThis court has progressively adopted a living constitutionalist approach. Varyingly, it has interpreted the\nConstitutional text by reference to Constitutional values (liberal democratic ideals which form the bedrock on which\nour text sits); a mix of cultural, social, political and historical ethos which surround our Constitutional text; a\nstructuralist technique typified by looking at the structural divisions of power within the Constitution and\ninterpreting it as an integrated whole etc. This court need not, in the abstract, fit a particular interpretative technique\nwithin specific pigeonholes of a living constitutionalist interpretation. Depending on which particular source is most\nuseful and what the matter at hand warrants, the court can resort to variants of a living constitutionalist\ninterpretation. This lack of rigidity allows for an enduring constitution.\nThe important criticisms against the living constitutionalist approach are that of uncertainty and that it can lead to\narbitrary exercise of judicial power. The living constitutionalist approach in my view is preferable despite these\ncriticisms, for two reasons. First, adaptability cannot be equated to lack of discipline in judicial reasoning. Second, it\nis still the text of the constitution which acquires the requisite interpretative hues and therefore, it is not as if there is\nviolence being perpetrated upon the text if one resorts to the living constitutionalist approach.\n20\nHis Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru & Others. v. State of Kerala & Another (1973) 4 SCC 225\n14\nnecessity of probing seriously and respectfully into the invisible\nportion of the Constitution cannot be ignored without being\ndisrespectful to the hard earned political freedom and the declared\naspirations of the liberty of ‘we the people of India’.                                            The text of\nenumerated fundamental rights is “only the primary source of expressed\ninformation” as to what is meant by liberty proclaimed by the\npreamble of the Constitution.\n13. To embrace a rule that the text of the Constitution is the only\nmaterial to be looked at to understand the purpose and scheme of\nthe Constitution would not only be detrimental to liberties of\nSUBJECTS but could also render the administration of the State\nunduly cumbersome. Fortunately, this Court did not adopt such a\nrule of interpretation barring exceptions like\nGopalan\n(supra) and\nADM Jabalpur21.\nElse, this Court could not have found the freedom\nof press under\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nand the other rights22 which were\n21\nADM Jabalpur Vs. S.S. Shukla AIR 1976 SC 1207\n22\nSakal Papers (P) Ltd. & Others etc. v. Union of India, AIR 1962 SC 305 at page 311\n“Para 28. It must be borne in mind that the Constitution must be interpreted in a broad way and not in a narrow\nand pedantic sense. Certain rights have been enshrined in our Constitution as fundamental and, therefore, while\nconsidering the nature and content of those rights the Court must not be too astute to interpret the language of\nthe Constitution in so literal a sense as to whittle them down. On the other hand the Court must interpret the\nConstitution in a manner which would enable the citizen to enjoy the rights guaranteed by it in the fullest\nmeasure subject, of course, to permissible restrictions. Bearing this principle in mind it would be clear that the\nright to freedom of speech and expression carries with it the right to publish and circulate one's ideas, opinions\nand views with complete freedom and by resorting to any available means of publication, subject again to such\nrestrictions as could be legitimately imposed under clause (2) of\nArticle 19.\nThe first decision of this Court in\nwhich this was recognized is\nRomesh Thapar v. State of Madras\n, AIR 1950 SC 124.. There, this Court held that\n15\nheld to be flowing from the guarantee under\nArticle 21.\nRomesh\nThappar23             and         Sakal          Papers\n(supra)          are        the        earliest\nacknowledgment by this Court of the existence of Constitution’s\ndark matter.             The series of cases in which this Court subsequently\nperceived various rights in the expression ‘life’ in\nArticle 21\nis a\nresounding confirmation of such acknowledgment.\n14. The U.S. VIth Amendment confers a “right to speedy and public\ntrial” to the accused, the right “to be informed of the nature and cause of\nthe accusation”, the right to have the “assistance of counsel for his defence”\netc.       None of those rights are expressed in the text of our\nConstitution.              Nonetheless, this Court declared these rights as\nimplicit in the text of\nArticles 14\nor 21. The VIIIth Amendment24 of\nthe      American             Constitution              contains           stipulations            prohibiting\nexcessive bails, fines, cruel and unusual punishments etc. Cruel\npunishments were not unknown to this country.\nThey were in\nvogue in the middle ages.                           Flaying a man alive was one of the\nfreedom of speech and expression includes freedom of propagation of ideas and that this freedom is ensured by\nthe freedom of circulation. In that case this Court has also pointed out that freedom of speech and expression are\nthe foundation of all democratic organisations and are essential for the proper functioning of the processes of\ndemocracy. ...”\n23\nRomesh Thappar Vs.

I only\nhope that this Court would have no occasion to hear an argument\nthat the Parliament or State legislatures would be constitutionally\ncompetent to prescribe cruel punishments like amputation or\nblinding or flaying alive of convicts merely an account of a\nprescription akin to the VIIIth Amendment being absent in our\nConstitution.25\n15. This Court by an interpretive process read the right to earn a\nlivelihood26, the right to education27, the right to speedy trial28, the\nright to protect one’s reputation29 and the right to have an\nenvironment free of pollution30 in the expression ‘life’ under\nArticle\n21\nof the Indian Constitution.\nSimilarly, the right to go abroad31 and the right to speedy trial\nof criminal cases32 were read into the expression liberty occurring\n25\nMithu Etc.

None of the above-mentioned rights are to be found anywhere\nin the text of the Constitution.\n17. To sanctify an argument that whatever is not found in the text\nof the Constitution cannot become a part of the Constitution would\nbe too primitive an understanding of the Constitution and contrary\nto settled cannons of constitutional interpretation. Such an\napproach regarding the rights and liberties of citizens would be an\naffront to the collective wisdom of our people and the wisdom of the\nmembers of the Constituent Assembly. The fact that some of the\nmembers opined during the course of debates in that Assembly,\nthat the right of privacy need not find an express mention in the\nConstitution, would not necessarily lead to the conclusion that they\nwere         oblivious         to    the      importance    of   the   right   to   privacy.\n33\nVatheeswaran, T.V.

A close scrutiny of the debates reveals that the\nAssembly only considered whether there should be an express\nprovision guaranteeing the right of privacy in the limited context of\n‘searches’ and ‘secrecy of correspondence’.                                Dimensions of the right\nof privacy are much larger and were not fully examined. The\nquestion whether the expression ‘liberty’ in\nArticle 21\ntakes within\nits sweep the various aspects of the right of privacy was also not\ndebated.               The submissions before us revolve around these\nquestions.           Petitioners assert that the right to privacy is a part of\nthe rights guaranteed under\nArticle 19\nand\n21\nand other Articles.\n18. The Constitution of any country reflects the aspirations and\ngoals of the people of that country voiced through the language of\nthe few chosen individuals entrusted with the responsibility of\nframing its Constitution. Such aspirations and goals depend upon\nthe history of that society. History invariably is a product of various\nforces emanating from religious, economic and political events35.\n35\nHowever, various forces which go into the making of history are dynamic. Those who are entrusted with the\nresponsibility of the working of the Constitution must necessarily keep track of the dynamics of such forces.\nEvolution of science and growth of technology is another major factor in the modern world which is equally a factor\nto be kept in mind to successfully work the constitution.\n19\nThe degree of refinement of the Constitution depends upon the\nwisdom of the people entrusted with the responsibility of framing\nthe Constitution. Constitution is not merely a document signed by\n284 members of the Constituent Assembly. It is a politically sacred\ninstrument created by men and women who risked lives and\nsacrificed their liberties to fight alien rulers and secured freedom for\nour people, not only of their generation but generations to follow.\nThe Constitution cannot be seen as a document written in ink to\nreplace one legal regime by another. It is a testament created for\nsecuring the goals professed in the Preamble36.                                            Part-III of the\nConstitution is incorporated to ensure achievement of the objects\ncontained in the Preamble.37 ‘We the People’ of this country are the\nintended beneficiaries38 of the Constitution. It must be seen as a\ndocument            written         in     the      blood        of    innumerable              martyrs          of\n36\nKesavananda Bharati (supra)\n“Para 91. … Our Preamble outlines the objectives of the whole constitution.\nIt expresses “what we had thought\nor dreamt for so long”.”\n37\nIn re, The Kerala Education Bill, 1957, AIR 1958 SC 956\n“… To implement and fortify these supreme purposes set forth in the Preamble, Part III of our Constitution has\nprovided for us certain fundamental rights.”\n38\nBidi Supply Co. v. Union of India & Others\n, AIR 1956 SC 479 at page 487\n“Para 23. After all, for whose benefit was the Constitution enacted? What was the point of making all this other\nabout fundamental rights? I am clear that the Constitution is not for the exclusive benefit governments and\nStates; it is not only for lawyers and politicians and officials and those highly placed. It also exists for the\ncommon man, for the poor and the humble, for those who have businesses at stake, for the “butcher, the baker\nand the candlestick maker”. It lays down for this land “a rule of law” as understood in the free democracies of\nthe world. It constitutes India into a Sovereign Republic and guarantees in every page rights and freedom to the\nside by side and consistent with the overriding power of the State to act for the common good of all.\n20\nJalianwala Bagh and the like. Man is not a creature of the State.\nLife and liberty are not granted by the Constitution. Constitution\nonly stipulates the limitations on the power of the State to interfere\nwith our life and liberty.     Law is essential to enjoy the fruits of\nliberty; it is not the source of liberty and emphatically not the\nexclusive source.\n19. To comprehend whether the right to privacy is a Fundamental\nRight falling within the sweep of any of the Articles of Part-III, it is\nnecessary to understand what “fundamental right” and the “right of\nprivacy” mean conceptually. Rights arise out of custom, contract or\nlegislation,   including   a   written   Constitution.   The   distinction\nbetween an ordinary legislation and an enacted Constitution is that\nthe latter is believed and expected to be a relatively permanent piece\nof legislation which cannot be abrogated by a simple majority of\nrepresentatives elected for a limited tenure to legislative bodies\ncreated thereby. The Constitution of any country is a document\nwhich contains provisions specifying the rules of governance in its\ndifferent aspects. It defines the powers of the legislature and the\nprocedures for law making, the powers of the executive to\nadminister the State by enforcing the law made by the legislature\n21\nand the powers of the judiciary. The underlying belief is that the\nConstitution of any country contains certain core political values\nand beliefs of the people of that country which cannot normally be\ntinkered with lightly, by transient public opinion.\n20. The Constitution of India is one such piece of legislation.\nComparable are constitutions of United States of America, Canada\nand Australia to mention only some.                              All such Constitutions apart\nfrom containing provisions for administration of the State, contain\nprovisions specifying or identifying certain rights of citizens and\neven some of the rights of non-citizens (both the classes of persons\ncould be collectively referred to as SUBJECTS for the sake of\nconvenience).              Such rights came to be described as “basic”,\n“primordial”, “inalienable” or “fundamental” rights. Such rights are\na protective wall against State’s power to destroy the liberty of the\nSUBJECTS.\nIrrespective         of     the      nomenclature               adopted          in      different\ncountries, such rights are believed in all democratic countries39 to\n39\nBidi Supply Co. v. Union of India & Others\n, AIR 1956 SC 479\nPara 24. I make no apology for turning to older democracies and drawing inspiration from them, for though our law\nis an amalgam drawn from many sources, its firmest foundations are rooted in the freedoms of other lands where\nmen are free in the democratic sense of the term. England has no fundamental rights as such and its Parliament is\nsupreme but the liberty of the subject is guarded there as jealously as the supremacy of Parliament.”\n22\nbe rights which cannot be abridged or curtailed totally by ordinary\nlegislation and unless it is established that it is so necessary to\nabridge or curtail those rights in the larger interest of the society.\nSeveral      Constitutions   contain   provisions   stipulating   various\nattendant conditions which any legislation intending to abridge\nsuch (fundamental) rights is required to comply with.\n21. Provisions of any written Constitution create rights and\nobligations, belonging either to individuals or the body politic as\nsuch. For example, the rights which are described as fundamental\nrights in Chapter-III of our Constitution are rights of individuals\nwhereas provisions of dealing with elections to legislative bodies\ncreate rights collectively in the body politic mandating periodic\nelections.     They also create rights in favour of individuals to\nparticipate in such electoral process either as an elector or to\nbecome an elected representative of the people/voters.\n22. Though each of the rights created by a Constitution is of great\nimportance for sustenance of a democratic form of Government\nchosen by us for achieving certain objectives declared in the\n23\nPreamble, the framers of our Constitution believed that some of the\nrights enshrined in the Constitution are more crucial to the pursuit\nof happiness of the people of India and, therefore, called them\nfundamental rights.     The belief is based on the study of human\nhistory and the Constitution of other nations which in turn are\nproducts of historical events.\nThe scheme of our Constitution is that the power of the State\nis divided along a vertical axis between the Union and the States\nand along the horizontal axis between the three great branches of\ngovernance, the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. Such\ndivision of power is believed to be conducive to preserving the\nliberties of the people of India.   The very purpose of creating a\nwritten Constitution is to secure justice, liberty and equality to the\npeople of India. Framers of the Constitution believed that certain\nfreedoms are essential to enjoy the fruits of liberty and that the\nState shall not be permitted to trample upon those freedoms except\nfor achieving certain important and specified objectives in the larger\ninterests of society.    Therefore, the authority of the State for\nmaking a law inconsistent with fundamental rights, is cabined\nwithin constitutionally proclaimed limitations.\n24\n23. Provisions akin to the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under\nour Constitution exist in American Constitution also40.                                                  They are\nanterior to our Constitution.\n24. The              inter-relationship                 of       various           fundamental                rights\nguaranteed under Part III of the Constitution and more specifically\nbetween\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\n21\nof the Constitution has been a\nmatter of great deal of judicial discourse starting from A.K. Gopalan.\nThe march of the law in this regard is recorded by Justices Nariman\nand Chandrachud in detail.\n25. R.C. Cooper and Maneka Gandhi gave a different orientation to\nthe topic.             Justice Bhagwati in Maneka Gandhi speaking for the\nmajority opined41 that in view of the later decision of this Court in\n40\nThe first 8 amendments to the Constitution are some of them.\n41\n5. ....It was in\nKharak Singh v. State of U.P. & Ors.\nthat the question as to the, proper scope and meaning of the\nexpression personal liberty' came up pointedly for consideration for the first time before this Court. The majority of\nthe Judges took the view \"that personal liberty' is used in the article as a compendious term to include within itself\nall the varieties of rights which go to make up the ‘personal liberties' of man other than those dealt with in the\nseveral clauses of\nArticle 19(1).\nIn other words, while\nArticle 19(1)\ndeals with particular species or attributes of that\nfreedom, 'personal liberty' in\nArticle 21\ntakes in and comprises the residue\". The minority judges, however,\ndisagreed with this view taken by the majority and explained their position in the following words : \"No doubt the\nexpression 'personal liberty' is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an attribute of personal liberty. It\nis said that the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty and, therefore, the expression 'personal\nliberty' in\nArticle 21\nexcludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach. Both are independent\nfundamental rights, though there is overlapping. There is no question of one being carved out of another. The\nfundamental right of life and personal liberty has many attributes and some of them are found in\nArticle 19.\nIf a\nperson's fundamental right under\nArticle 21\nis infringed, the State can rely upon a law to sustain the action, but that\ncannot be a complete answer unless the said law satisfies the test\nlaid down in\nArticle 19(2)\nso far as the attributes\ncovered by\nArticle 19(1)\nare concerned\". There can be no doubt that in view of the decision of this Court in R. C.\n25\nR.C. Cooper, the minority view (in Kharak Singh) must be regarded\nas correct and the majority view must be held to be overruled.\nConsequently, it was held that any law which deprives any person\nof the liberty guaranteed under\nArticle 21\nmust not only be just, fair\nand reasonable, but must also satisfy that it does not at the same\ntime violate one or some of the other fundamental rights\nenumerated under\nArticle 19\n, by demonstrating that the law is\nstrictly in compliance with one of the corresponding clauses 2 to 6\nof\nArticle 19.42\n26.\nIn Kharak Singh, Ayyangar, J. speaking for the majority held\nthat the expression ‘personal liberty’ used in\nArticle 21\nis a\n“compendious term to include within itself all varieties of rights which”\nCooper v. Union of India\n(2) the minority view must be regarded as correct and the majority view must be held to\nhave been overruled…….\n42\n6. …..The law, must, therefore, now be taken to be well settled that\nArticle 21\ndoes not exclude\nArticle 19\nand\nthat even if there is a law prescribing a procedure for depriving a person of 'personal liberty' and there is\nconsequently no infringement of the fundamental right conferred by\nArticle 21\n, such law, in so far as it abridges or\ntakes away any fundamental right under\nArticle 19\nwould have to meet the challenge of that article. This proposition\ncan no longer be disputed after the decisions in R. C. Cooper's case,\nShambhu Nath Sarkar\n's case and Haradhan\nSaha's case. Now, if a law depriving a person of 'personal liberty' and prescribing a procedure for that purpose\nwithin the meaning of\nArticle 21\nhas to stand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred\nunder\nArticle 19\nwhich may be applicable in a given situation, ex hypothesi it must also be liable to be tested with\nreference to\nArticle 14.\nThis was in fact not disputed by the learned Attorney General and indeed he could not do so\nin view of the clear and categorical statement made by Mukharjea, J., in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case that\nArticle 21\n\"\npresupposes that the law is a valid and binding law under the provisions of the Constitution having regard to the\ncompetence of the legislature and the subject it relates to and does not infringe any of the fundamental rights which\nthe Constitution provides for\", including\nArticle 14.....\n26\nconstitute the “personal liberties of a man other than those specified in the\nseveral clauses of\nArticle 19(1)\n.”               In other words,\nArticle 19(1)\ndeals with\nparticular “species or attributes of personal liberty” mentioned in Article\n21. “Article 21 takes in and comprises the residue.”                            Such a construction\nwas not accepted by the minority. The minority opined that both\nArticles 19\nand\n21\nare independent fundamental rights but they are\noverlapping.43\n27. An analysis of Kharak Singh reveals that the minority opined\nthat the right to move freely is an attribute of personal liberty.\nMinority only disputed the correctness of the proposition that by\nenumerating certain freedoms in\nArticle 19(1)\n, the makers of the\nConstitution excluded those freedoms from the expression liberty in\nArticle 21.\nThe minority opined that both the freedoms enumerated\nin\nArticle 19(1)\nand\n21\nare independent fundamental rights, though\nthere is “overlapping”.\nThe expression ‘liberty’ is capable of taking within its sweep\nnot only the right to move freely, guaranteed under\nArticle 19(1)(d);\n43\nNo doubt the expression “personal liberty” is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an attribute of\npersonal liberty. It is said that the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty and, therefore, the\nexpression “personal liberty” in\nArt. 21\nexcludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach. Both\nare independent fundamental rights, though there is overlapping.\n27\nbut also each one of the other freedoms mentioned under\nArticle\n19(1).\nPersonal liberty takes within its sweep not only the right not\nto be subjected to physical restraints, but also the freedom of\nthought, belief, emotion and sensation and a variety of other\nfreedoms.            The most basic understanding of the expression liberty\nis the freedom of an individual to do what he pleases.                 But the idea\nof liberty is more complex than that.                         Abraham Lincoln’s\nstatement44              that our nation “was conceived in liberty” is equally\nrelevant in the context of the proclamation contained in our\nPreamble; and as evocatively expressed in the words of Justice\nBrandies;\n“Those who won our independence believed that the final end\nof the State was to make men free to develop their faculties;\nand that in its government the deliberative forces should\nprevail over the arbitrary. They valued liberty both as an end\nand as a means. They believed liberty to be the secret of\nhappiness and courage to be the secret of liberty.”\n– Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 375\n28. The question now arises as to what is the purpose the framers\nof the Constitution sought to achieve by specifically enumerating\nsome of the freedoms which otherwise would form part of the\nexpression ‘liberty’. To my mind the answer is that the Constituent\n44\nGettysburg Speech\n28\nAssembly thought it fit that some aspects of liberty require a more\nemphatic declaration so as to restrict the authority of the State to\nabridge or curtail them. The need for such an emphatic declaration\narose from the history of this nation. In my opinion, the purpose\nsought to be achieved is two-fold. Firstly, to place the expression\n‘liberty’ beyond the argumentative process45 of ascertaining the\nmeaning of the expression liberty, and secondly, to restrict the\nauthority of the State to abridge those enumerated freedoms only to\nachieve the purposes indicated in the corresponding clauses (2) to\n(6) of\nArticle 19.46\nIt must be remembered that the authority of the\n45\nThat was exactly the State’s submission in A.K.

When it comes to deprivation\nof the freedoms under\nArticle 19(1)\n, the requirement is: (a) that\nthere must not only be a law but such law must be tailored to\nachieve the purposes indicated in the corresponding sub-Article47;\nand (b) to declare that the various facets of liberty enumerated in\nArticle 19(1)\nare available only to the citizens of the country but not\nall SUBJECTS.48                 As it is now clearly held by this Court that the\nrights guaranteed under\nArticles 14\nand\n21\nare not confined only to\ncitizens but available even to non-citizens aliens or incorporated\nbodies even if they are incorporated in India etc.\n29. The inter-relationship of\nArticle 19\nand\n21\n, if as understood by\nme, as stated in para 28, the authority of the State to deprive any\nperson of his liberty is circumscribed by certain factors;\n(1) It can only be done under the authority of law\n47\nThat was exactly the State’s submission in A.K. Gopalan’s case which unfortunately found favour with this Court.\n48\nSee\nHans Muller of Nurenburg Vs.

My endeavour qua the aforesaid analysis is only to establish\nthat the expression liberty in\nArticle 21\nis wide enough to take in\nnot only the various freedoms enumerated in\nArticle 19(1)\nbut also\nmany others which are not enumerated.       I am of the opinion that a\nbetter view of the whole scheme of the chapter on fundamental\nrights is to look at each one of the guaranteed fundamental rights\nnot as a series of isolated points, but as a rational continuum of the\nlegal concept of liberty i.e. freedom from all substantial, arbitrary\n31\nencroachments and purposeless restraints sought to be made by\nthe State. Deprivation of liberty could lead to curtailment of one or\nmore of freedoms which a human being possesses, but for\ninterference by the State.\n31. Whether it is possible to arrive at a coherent, integrated and\nstructured statement explaining the right of privacy is a question\nthat has been troubling scholars and judges in various jurisdictions\nfor decades.49 Considerable amount of literature both academic and\njudicial came into existence.                        In this regard various taxonomies50\nhave been proposed suggesting that there are a number of interests\nand values into which the right to privacy could be dissected.\n32. Claims for protection of privacy interests can arise against the\nState and its instrumentalities and against non-State entities –\nsuch as, individuals acting in their private capacity and bodies\ncorporate or unincorporated associations etc., without any element\nof State participation.                   Apart from academic literature, different\n49\nGobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Another\n, (1975) 2 SCC 148\n“Para 23. … The most serious advocate of privacy must confess that there are serious problems of defining the\nessence and scope of the right. …”\n50\nFor a detailed account of the taxonomy of the constitutional right to privacy in India see, Mariyam Kamil, ‘The\nStructure of the Right to Privacy in India’ (MPhil thesis, University of Oxford, 2015).\n32\nclaims based on different asserted privacy interests have also found\njudicial support. Cases arose in various jurisdictions in the context\nof privacy interests based on (i) Common Law; (ii) statutory\nrecognition; and (iii) constitutionally protected claims of the right of\nprivacy.\n33. I am of the opinion that for answering the present reference,\nthis Court is only concerned with the question whether SUBJECTS\nwho are amenable to the laws of this country have a Fundamental\nRight of Privacy against the State51. The text of the Constitution is\nsilent in this regard. Therefore, it is required to examine whether\nsuch a right is implied in any one or more of the Fundamental\nRights in the text of the Constitution.\n34. To answer the above question, it is necessary to understand\nconceptually identify the nature of the right to privacy.\n35. My learned brothers have discussed various earlier decisions\nof this Court and of the Courts of other countries, dealing with the\nclaims        of     the      Right        of     Privacy.         International             Treaties          and\nConventions have been referred to to establish the existence and\n51\nIt is a settled principle of law that some of the Fundamental Rights like 14 and 29 are guaranteed even to non-\ncitizens\n33\nrecognition of the right to privacy in the various parts of the world,\nand have opined that they are to be read into our Constitution in\norder to conclude that there exists a Fundamental Right to privacy\nunder our Constitution. While Justice Nariman opined –\n“94. This reference is answered by stating that the inalienable\nfundamental right to privacy resides in\nArticle 21\nand other\nfundamental freedoms contained in Part III of the Constitution of\nIndia. M.P. Sharma (supra) and the majority in Kharak Singh\n(supra), to the extent that they indicate to the contrary, stand\noverruled. The later judgments of this Court recognizing privacy as\na fundamental right do not need to be revisited. These cases are,\ntherefore, sent back for adjudication on merits to the original\nBench of 3 honourable Judges of this Court in light of the\njudgment just delivered by us.”\nJustice Chandrachud held :\n“(C) Privacy is a constitutionally protected right which emerges\nprimarily from the guarantee of life and personal liberty in\nArticle\n21\nof the Constitution. Elements of privacy also arise in varying\ncontexts from the other facets of freedom and dignity recognised\nand guaranteed by the fundamental rights contained in Part III;”\n36. One of the earliest cases where the constitutionality of State’s\naction allegedly infringing the right of privacy fell for the\nconsideration of the US Supreme Court is Griswold et al v.\nConnecticut, 381 US 479. The Supreme Court of the United States\nsustained a claim of a privacy interest on the theory that the\nConstitution itself creates certain zones of privacy - ‘repose’ and\n34\n‘intimate       decision.52         Building         on this         framework,           Bostwick53\nsuggested that there are in fact, three aspects of privacy – “repose”,\n“sanctuary” and “intimate decision”. “Repose” refers to freedom\nfrom unwarranted stimuli, “sanctuary” to protection against\nintrusive observation, and “intimate decision” to autonomy with\nrespect to the most personal life choices. Whether any other facet\nof the right of privacy exists cannot be divined now. In my opinion,\nthere is no need to resolve all definitional concerns at an abstract\nlevel to understand the nature of the right to privacy. The ever\ngrowing possibilities of technological and psychological intrusions\nby the State into the liberty of SUBJECTS must leave some doubt in\nthis context. Definitional uncertainty is no reason to not recognize\nthe existence of the right of privacy. For the purpose of this case, it\nis sufficient to go by the understanding that the right to privacy\nconsists of three facets i.e. repose, sanctuary and intimate decision.\nEach of these facets is so essential for the liberty of human beings\nthat I see no reason to doubt that the right to privacy is part of the\nliberty guaranteed by our Constitution.\n52\nGriswold v Connecticut 381 US 479 (1965) 487.\n53\nGary Bostwick, ‘A Taxonomy of Privacy: Repose, Sanctuary, and Intimate Decision’ (1976) 64 California Law\nReview 1447.\n35\n37. History abounds with examples of attempts by governments to\nshape the minds of SUBJECTS.                                 In other words, conditioning the\nthought process by prescribing what to read or not to read; what\nforms of art alone are required to be appreciated leading to the\nconditioning of beliefs; interfering with the choice of people\nregarding the kind of literature, music or art which an individual\nwould prefer to enjoy.54 Such conditioning is sought to be achieved\nby screening the source of information or prescribing penalties for\nmaking choices which governments do not approve.55                                                  Insofar as\nreligious beliefs are concerned, a good deal of the misery our\nspecies suffer owes its existence to and centres around competing\nclaims of the right to propagate religion.                                      Constitution of India\nprotects the liberty of all SUBJECTS guaranteeing56 the freedom of\n54\nStanley Vs.

Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion.-\n(1) Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally\nentitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion.\n(2) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any law-\n(a) regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with\nreligious practice;\n(b) providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character\nto all classes and sections of Hindus.\nExplanation I.- The wearing and carrying of kirpans shall be deemed to be included in the profession of the Sikh\nreligion.\n36\nconscience and right to freely profess, practice and propagate\nreligion.           While the right to freely “profess, practice and propagate\nreligion” may be a facet of free speech guaranteed under\nArticle\n19(1)(a)\n, the freedom of the belief or faith in any religion is a matter\nof conscience falling within the zone of purely private thought\nprocess and is an aspect of liberty.                                 There are areas other than\nreligious beliefs which form part of the individual’s freedom of\nconscience such as political belief etc. which form part of the liberty\nunder\nArticle 21.\n38. Concerns of privacy arise when the State seeks to intrude into\nthe body of SUBJECTS.57                                 Corporeal punishments were not\nunknown to India, their abolition is of a recent vintage.                                                   Forced\nfeeding of certain persons by the State raises concerns of privacy.\nAn individual’s rights to refuse life prolonging medical treatment or\nterminate his life is another freedom which fall within the zone of\nthe right of privacy. I am conscious of the fact that the issue is\npending before this Court. But in various other jurisdictions, there\nExplanation II.- In sub-clause (b) of clause (2), the reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to\npersons professing the Sikh, Jaina or Buddhist religion, and the reference to Hindu religious institutions shall be\nconstrued accordingly.\\\n57\nSkinner Vs.

The right to travel freely within the\ncountry or go abroad is an area falling within the right of privacy.\nThe text of our Constitution recognised the freedom to travel\nthroughout the country under\nArticle 19(1)(d).\nThis Court has\nalready recognised that such a right takes within its sweep the right\nto travel abroad.59 A person’s freedom to choose the place of his\nresidence once again is a part of his right of privacy60 recognised by\nthe Constitution of India under\nArticle 19(1)(e)\nthough the pre-\ndominant purpose of enumerating the above mentioned two\nfreedoms in\nArticle 19(1)\nis to disable both the federal and State\nGovernments from creating barriers which are incompatible with\nthe federal nature of our country and its Constitution.

Such a freedom need not necessarily\nbe based on religious beliefs falling under\nArticle 25.\nInformational\ntraces are also an area which is the subject matter of huge debate\nin various jurisdictions falling within the realm of the right of\nprivacy, such data is as personal as that of the choice of\nappearance and apparel. Telephone tappings and internet hacking\nby State, of personal data is another area which falls within the\nrealm of privacy. The instant reference arises out of such an\nattempt by the Union of India to collect bio-metric data regarding all\nthe residents of this country.\nThe above-mentioned are some of the areas where some\ninterest of privacy exists. The examples given above indicate to\nsome extent the nature and scope of the right of privacy.\n40. I do not think that anybody in this country would like to have\nthe officers of the State intruding into their homes or private\nproperty at will or soldiers quartered in their houses without their\n39\nconsent. I do not think that anybody would like to be told by the\nState as to what they should eat or how they should dress or whom\nthey should be associated with either in their personal, social or\npolitical life. Freedom of social and political association is\nguaranteed to citizens under\nArticle 19(1)(c).\nPersonal association\nis still a doubtful area.61                  The decision making process regarding\nthe freedom of association, freedoms of travel and residence are\npurely private and fall within the realm of the right of privacy. It is\none of the most intimate decisions.\nAll liberal democracies believe that the State should not have\nunqualified authority to intrude into certain aspects of human life\nand      that       the      authority         should         be      limited        by     parameters\nconstitutionally              fixed.       Fundamental                rights        are       the       only\nconstitutional firewall to prevent State’s interference with those core\nfreedoms constituting liberty of a human being.                                           The right to\nprivacy is certainly one of the core freedoms which is to be\n61\nThe High Court of AP held that\nArticle 19(1)(c)\nwould take within its sweep the matrimonial association in\nT.\nSareetha Vs. T. Venkata Subbaiah\n, AIR 1983 AP 356.\nHowever, this case was later overruled by this Court in\nSaroj Rani Vs. Sudarshan Kumar Chadha\n, AIR 1984 SC 1562\n40\ndefended. It is part of liberty within the meaning of that expression\nin\nArticle 21.\n41. I am in complete agreement with the conclusions recorded by\nmy learned brothers in this regard.\n42. It goes without saying that no legal right can be absolute.\nEvery right has limitations.    This aspect of the matter is conceded\nat the bar. Therefore, even a fundamental right to privacy has\nlimitations.     The limitations are to be identified on case to case\nbasis depending upon the nature of the privacy interest claimed.\nThere are different standards of review to test infractions of\nfundamental rights. While the concept of reasonableness overarches\nPart III, it operates differently across Articles (even if only slightly\ndifferently across some of them). Having emphatically interpreted\nthe Constitution’s liberty guarantee to contain a fundamental right\nof privacy, it is necessary for me to outline the manner in which\nsuch a right to privacy can be limited. I only do this to indicate the\ndirection of the debate as the nature of limitation is not at issue\nhere.\n41\n43. To begin with, the options canvassed for limiting the right to\nprivacy include an\nArticle 14\ntype reasonableness enquiry62;\nlimitation as per the express provisions of\nArticle 19;\na just, fair and\nreasonable basis (that is, substantive due process) for limitation per\nArticle 21;\nand finally, a just, fair and reasonable standard per\nArticle 21\nplus the amorphous standard of ‘compelling state\ninterest’. The last of these four options is the highest standard of\nscrutiny63 that a court can adopt. It is from this menu that a\nstandard of review for limiting the right of privacy needs to be\nchosen.\n44. At the very outset, if a privacy claim specifically flows only\nfrom one of the expressly enumerated provisions under\nArticle 19\n,\nthen the standard of review would be as expressly provided under\nArticle 19.\nHowever, the possibility of a privacy claim being entirely\ntraceable to rights other than\nArt. 21\nis bleak. Without discounting\nthat possibility, it needs to be noted that\nArt. 21\nis the bedrock of\n62A  challenge under\nArticle 14\ncan be made if there is an unreasonable classification and/or if the impugned\nmeasure is arbitrary. The classification is unreasonable if there is no intelligible differentia justifying the\nclassification and if the classification has no rational nexus with the objective sought to be achieved. Arbitrariness,\nwhich was first explained at para 85 of\nE.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu\n, AIR 1974 SC 555, is very simply the\nlack of any reasoning.\n63\nA tiered level of scrutiny was indicated in what came to be known as the most famous footnote in Constitutional\nlaw that is Footnote Four in United States v. Carolene Products, 304 U.S. 144 (1938). Depending on the graveness\nof the right at stake, the court adopts a correspondingly rigorous standard of scrutiny.\n42\nthe privacy guarantee. If the spirit of liberty permeates every claim\nof privacy, it is difficult if not impossible to imagine that any\nstandard of limitation, other than the one under\nArticle 21\napplies.\nIt is for this reason that I will restrict the available options to the\nlatter two from the above described four.\n45. The just, fair and reasonable standard of review under\nArticle\n21\nneeds no elaboration. It has also most commonly been used in\ncases dealing with a privacy claim hitherto.64 Gobind resorted to the\ncompelling state interest standard in addition to the\nArticle 21\nreasonableness enquiry. From the                                 United States where                      the\nterminology of ‘compelling state interest’ originated, a strict\nstandard of scrutiny comprises two things- a ‘compelling state\ninterest’ and a requirement of ‘narrow tailoring’ (narrow tailoring\nmeans that the law must be narrowly framed to achieve the\nobjective). As a term, compelling state interest does not have\ndefinite contours in the US. Hence, it is critical that this standard\nbe adopted with some clarity as to when and in what types of\nprivacy claims it is to be used. Only in privacy claims which deserve\n64\nDistrict Registrar & Collector, Hyderabad v Canara Bank\nAIR 2005 SC 186;\nState of Maharashtra v Bharat Shanti\nLal Shah\n(2008) 13 SCC 5.\n43\nthe strictest scrutiny is the standard of compelling State interest to\nbe used. As for others, the just, fair and reasonable standard under\nArticle 21\nwill apply. When the compelling State interest standard\nis to be employed must depend upon the context of concrete cases.\nHowever, this discussion sets the ground rules within which a\nlimitation for the right of privacy is to be found.\n..….....................................J.\n(J.

This reference calls on us to answer questions that would go to\nthe very heart of the liberty and freedom protected by the Constitution\nof India.   It arises in the context of a constitutional challenge to the\nAadhaar project, which aims to build a database of personal identity and\nbiometric information covering every Indian – the world’s largest\nendeavour of its kind. To the Petitioners’ argument therein that Aadhaar\nwould violate the right to privacy, the Union of India, through its\nAttorney General, raised the objection that Indians could claim no\n2\nconstitutional right of privacy in view of a unanimous decision of 8\nJudges of this Court in\nM.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra1\nand a decision\nby a majority of 4 Judges in\nKharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh2\n.\n2.       The question, which was framed by a Bench of three of us and\ntravels to us from a Bench of five, was the following:\n“12. We are of the opinion that the cases on hand\nraise far-reaching questions of importance involving\ninterpretation of the Constitution. What is at stake is\nthe amplitude of the fundamental rights including\nthat precious and inalienable right under\nArticle 21.\nIf the observations made in MP Sharma and Kharak\nSingh are to be read literally and accepted as the law\nof this country, the fundamental rights guaranteed\nunder the Constitution of India and more particularly\nright to liberty under\nArticle 21\nwould be denuded of\nvigour and vitality. At the same time, we are also of\nthe opinion that the institutional integrity and judicial\ndiscipline require that pronouncements made by\nlarger Benches of this Court cannot be ignored by\nsmaller Benches without appropriately explaining the\nreasons for not following the pronouncements made\nby such larger Benches. With due respect to all the\nlearned Judges who rendered subsequent judgments\n– where right to privacy is asserted or referred to\ntheir Lordships concern for the liberty of human\nbeings, we are of the humble opinion that there\nappears to be certain amount of apparent unresolved\ncontradiction in the law declared by this Court.\n13. Therefore, in our opinion to give quietus to the\nkind of controversy raised in this batch of cases once\nand for all, it is better that the ratio decidendi of MP\nSharma and Kharak Singh is scrutinized and the\n1\nMP Sharma v.

We would like to record our appreciation for their able\nassistance in a matter of such great import as the case before us.\n3\nJustice KS Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India, W.P. (Civil) No. 494 of 2012, Order dated\n11 August 2015\n4\nThe Effect of M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh\n4.     The question of whether\nArticle 21\nencompasses a fundamental\nright to privacy did not fall for consideration before the 8 Judges in the\nM.P. Sharma Court.      Rather, the question was whether an improper\nsearch and seizure operation undertaken against a company and its\ndirectors would violate the constitutional bar against testimonial\ncompulsion contained in\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution. This Court\nheld that such a search did not violate\nArticle 20(3).\nIts reasoning\nproceeded on the footing that the absence of a fundamental right to\nprivacy analogous to the Fourth Amendment to the United States’\nconstitution in our own constitution suggested that the Constituent\nAssembly chose not to subject laws providing for search and seizure to\nconstitutional limitations. Consequently, this Court had no defensible\nground on which to import such a right into\nArticle 20(3)\n, which was, at\nany event, a totally different right.\n5.     M.P. Sharma is unconvincing not only because it arrived at its\nconclusion without enquiry into whether a privacy right could exist in\nour Constitution on an independent footing or not, but because it\n5\nwrongly took the United States Fourth Amendment – which in itself is no\nmore than a limited protection against unlawful surveillance – to be a\ncomprehensive constitutional guarantee of privacy in that jurisdiction.\n6.      Neither does the 4:2 majority in\nKharak Singh v. State of Uttar\nPradesh\n(supra) furnish a basis for the proposition that no constitutional\nright to privacy exists. Ayyangar, J.’s opinion for the majority found that\nRegulation 236 (b) of the Uttar Pradesh Police Regulations, which inter\nalia enabled the police to make domiciliary visits at night was “plainly\nviolative of Article 21”4. In reasoning towards this conclusion, the Court\nimpliedly acknowledged a constitutional right to privacy. In particular, it\nbegan by finding that though India has no like guarantee to the Fourth\nAmendment, “an unauthorised intrusion into a person’s home and the\ndisturbance caused to him thereby, is as it were the violation of a\ncommon law right of a man – an ultimate essential of ordered liberty, if\nnot of the very concept of civilization”5. It proceeded to affirm that the\nstatement in Semayne’s case6 that “the house of everyone is to him as\n4\nId., at p. 350\n5\nId., at p. 349\n6\n(1604) 5 Coke 91\n6\nhis castle and fortress as well as for his defence against injury and\nviolence as for his repose” articulated an “abiding principle which\ntranscends mere protection of property rights and expounds a concept\nof “personal liberty.” Thus far, the Kharak Singh majority makes out the\ncase of the Attorney General. But, in its final conclusion, striking down\nRegulation 236 (b) being violative of\nArticle 21\ncould not have been\narrived at without allowing that a right of privacy was covered by that\nguarantee.\n7.      The M.P. Sharma Court did not have the benefit of two\ninterpretative devices that have subsequently become indispensable\ntools in this Court’s approach to adjudicating constitutional cases. The\nfirst of these devices derives from R.C. Cooper v. Union of India7 and its\nprogeny – including\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India8\n– which require\nus to read Part III’s guarantees of rights together.\nUnlike AK Gopalan v.\nState of Madras9\nwhich held the field in M.P. Sharma’s time, rights\ndemand to be read as overlapping rather than in silos, so that Part III is\nnow conceived as a constellation of harmonious and mutually reinforcing\n7\n(1970) 1 SCC 248\n8\n(1978) 1 SCC 248\n9\nAIR 1950 SC 27\n7\nguarantees. Part III does not attempt to delineate rights specifically.\nI take the right to privacy, an indispensable part of personal liberty, to\nhave this character. Such a view would have been wholly untenable in\nthe AK Gopalan era.\n8.      M.P.     Sharma   also   predates   the   practice   of   the   judicial\nenumeration of rights implicit in a guarantee instantiated in the\nconstitutional text. As counsel for the Petitioners correctly submitted,\nthere is a whole host of rights that this court has derived from\nArticle 21\nto evidence that enumeration is a well-embedded interpretative practice\nin constitutional law. Article 21’s guarantee to the right to ‘life’ is home\nto such varied rights as the right to go abroad (\nManeka Gandhi v. Union\nof India\n), the right to livelihood (\nOlga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal\nCorporation10\n) and the right to medical care (\nParamanand Katara v.\nUnion of India11\n).\n9.      Therefore, nothing in M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh supports\nthe conclusion that there is no fundamental right to privacy in our\n10\n(1985) 3 SCC 545\n11\n(1989) 4 SCC 286\n8\nConstitution. These two decisions and their inconclusiveness on the\nquestion before the Court today have been discussed in great detail in\nthe opinions of Chelameswar J., Nariman J., and Chandrachud J.,\nI agree with their conclusion in this regard. To the extent that stray\nobservations taken out of their context may suggest otherwise, the shift\nin our understanding of the nature and location of various fundamental\nrights in Part III brought about by R.C. Cooper and Maneka Gandhi has\nremoved the foundations of M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh.\n10.     Petitioners submitted that decisions numbering atleast 30 –\nbeginning with Mathews, J.’s full-throated acknowledgement of the\nexistence and value of a legal concept of privacy in\nGobind v. State of\nM.P.12\n– form an unbroken line of cases that affirms the existence of a\nconstitutional right to privacy. In view of the foregoing, this view should\nbe accepted as correct.\nThe Form of the Privacy Right\n11.      It was argued for the Union by Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned\nAttorney General that the right of privacy may at best be a common law\n12\n(1975) 2 SCC 148\n9\nright, but not a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. This\nsubmission is difficult to accept. In order to properly appreciate the\nargument, an exposition of the first principles concerning the nature and\nevolution of rights is necessary.\n12.     According to Salmond, rights are interests protected by ‘rules of\nright’, i.e., by moral or legal rules13. When interests are worth\nprotecting on moral grounds, irrespective of the existence of a legal\nsystem or the operation of law, they are given the name of a natural\nright. Accordingly, Roscoe Pound refers to natural law as a theory of\nmoral qualities inherent in human beings, and to natural rights as\ndeductions demonstrated by reason from human nature14.             He defines\nnatural rights, and distinguishes them from legal rights (whether at\ncommon law or under constitutions) in the following way:\n“Natural rights mean simply interests which we think\nought to be secured demands which human beings\nmay make which we think ought to be satisfied. It is\nperfectly true that neither law nor state creates\nthem. But it is fatal to all sound thinking to treat\nthem as legal conceptions. For legal rights, the\ndevices which law employs to secure such of these\n13\nPJ FITZGERALD, SALMOND ON JURISPRUDENCE 217 (Twelfth Edition, 1966)\n14\nROSCOE POUND, THE SPIRIT OF THE COMMON LAW 88 (1921)\n10\ninterests as it is expedient to recognize, are the work\nof the law and in that sense the work of the state.”15\nPrivacy, with which we are here concerned, eminently qualifies as an\ninalienable natural right, intimately connected to two values whose\nprotection is a matter of universal moral agreement: the innate dignity\nand autonomy of man.\n13.           Legal systems,   which in India as      in England,    began as\nmonarchies, concentrated the power of the government in the person of\nthe king. English common law, whether it is expressed in the laws of the\nmonarch and her Parliament, or in the decisions of the Courts, is the\nsource of what the Attorney General correctly takes to be our own\ncommon law. Semayne’s case16, in which it was affirmed that a man’s\nhome is his castle and that even the law may only enter it with warrant,\nclearly shows that elements of the natural right of privacy began to be\nreceived into the common law as early as in 1604. Where a natural law\nright could not have been enforced at law, the common law right is\n15\nId., at p. 92\n16\n(1604) 5 Coke 91\n11\nevidently an instrument by which invasions into the valued interest in\nquestion by one’s fellow man can be addressed. On the very same\nrationale as Seymayne, Chapter 17 of the\nIndian Penal Code\n, 1860,\ntreats trespass against property as a criminal offence17.\n14.     With the advent of democracy and of limited constitutional\ngovernment came the state, a new actor with an unprecedented capacity\nto interfere with natural and common law rights alike. The state differs in\ntwo material ways from the monarch, the previous site in which\ngovernmental power (including the power to compel compliance through\npenal laws) was vested. First, the state is an abstract and diffuse entity,\nwhile the monarch was a tangible, single entity. Second, the advent of\nthe state came with a critical transformation in the status of the\ngoverned from being subjects under the monarch to becoming citizens,\n17\nSeveral other pre-constitutional enactments which codify the common law also\nacknowledge a right to privacy, both as between the individuals and the government, as\nwell as between individuals inter se. These include:\n1.\nS. 126-9\n, The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (protecting certain classes of\ncommunication as privileged)\n2.\nS. 4\n, The Indian Easements Act, 1882 (defining ‘easements’ as the right to\nchoose how to use and enjoy a given piece of land)\n3.\nS. 5(2)\n, The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (specifying the permissible grounds for\nthe Government to order the interception of messages)\n4.\nS. 5\nand\n6\n, The Bankers Books (Evidence) Act, 1891 (mandating a court order for\nthe production and inspection of bank records)\n5.\nS. 25\nand\n26\n, The Indian Post Office Act, 1898 (specifying the permissible\ngrounds for the interception of postal articles)\n12\nand themselves becoming agents of political power qua the state.\nConstitutions like our own are means by which individuals – the\nPreambular ‘people of India’ – create ‘the state’, a new entity to serve\ntheir interests and be accountable to them, and transfer a part of their\nsovereignty to it. The cumulative effect of both these circumstances is\nthat individuals governed by constitutions have the new advantage of a\ngoverning entity that draws its power from and is accountable to them,\nbut they face the new peril of a diffuse and formless entity against whom\nexisting remedies at common law are no longer efficacious.\n15.     Constitutions address the rise of the new political hegemon that\nthey create by providing for a means by which to guard against its\ncapacity for invading the liberties available and guaranteed to all civilized\npeoples. Under our constitutional scheme, these means – declared to be\nfundamental rights – reside in Part III, and are made effective by the\npower of this Court and the High Courts under\nArticles 32\nand\n226\nrespectively. This narrative of the progressive expansion of the types of\nrights available to individuals seeking to defend their liberties from\ninvasion – from natural rights to common law rights and finally to\n13\nfundamental rights – is consistent with the account of the development\nof rights that important strands in constitutional theory present18.\n16.      This court has already recognized the capacity of constitutions to\nbe the means by which to declare recognized natural rights as applicable\nqua the state, and of constitutional courts to enforce these declarations.\nIn Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala19, Mathew, J. borrows from\nRoscoe Pound to explain this idea in the following terms:\n“While   dealing    with    natural      rights, Roscoe\nPound states on p. 500 of Vol. I of his Jurisprudence:\n“Perhaps nothing contributed so much to create and\nfoster hostility to courts and law and constitutions as\nthis conception of the courts as guardians of\nindividual natural rights against the State and\nagainst society; this conceiving of the law as a final\nand absolute body of doctrine declaring these\nindividual natural rights; this theory of constitutions\nas declaratory of common law principles, which are\nalso natural-law principles, anterior to the State and\nof superior validity to enactments by the authority of\nthe state; this theory of Constitutions as having\nfor their purpose to guarantee and maintain the\nnatural rights of individuals against the\nGovernment and all its agencies.In effect, it set\nup the received traditional social, political, and\neconomic ideals of the legal profession as a super-\nconstitution, beyond the reach of any agency but\njudicial decision.” (Emphasis supplied)\n18\nMARTIN LOUGHLIN, THE FOUNDATIONS OF PUBLIC LAW 344-46 (2010)\n19\n(1973) 4 SCC 225, 1461 at p. 783\n14\nThis Court also recognizes the true nature of the relation between the\ncitizen and the state as well as the true character and utility of Part III.\nAccordingly, in People’s\nUnion of Civil Liberties v. Union of India20\n, it has\nrecently been affirmed that the objective of Part III is to place citizens at\ncentre stage and make the state accountable to them.\nIn Society for\nUnaided Private Schools of Rajasthan v. Union of India21\n, it was held that\n“[f]undamental rights have two aspects, firstly, they act as fetter on\nplenary legislative powers, and secondly, they provide conditions for\nfuller development of our people including their individual dignity.”\n17.       Once we have arrived at this understanding of the nature of\nfundamental rights, we can dismantle a core assumption of the Union’s\nargument: that a right must either be a common law right or a\nfundamental right. The only material distinctions between the two\nclasses of right – of which the nature and content may be the same – lie\nin the incidence of the duty to respect the right and in the forum in which\na failure to do so can be redressed. Common law rights are horizontal in\n20\n(2005) 2 SCC 436\n21\n(2012) 6 SCC 1 at 27\n15\ntheir operation when they are violated by one’s fellow man, he can be\nnamed and proceeded against in an ordinary court of law. Constitutional\nand fundamental rights, on the other hand, provide remedy against the\nviolation of a valued interest by the ‘state’, as an abstract entity,\nwhether through legislation or otherwise, as well as by identifiable public\nofficials, being individuals clothed with the powers of the state. It is\nperfectly possible for an interest to simultaneously be recognized as a\ncommon law right and a fundamental right. Where the interference with\na recognized interest is by the state or any other like entity recognized\nby\nArticle 12\n, a claim for the violation of a fundamental right would lie.\nWhere the author of an identical interference is a non-state actor, an\naction at common law would lie in an ordinary court.\n18.     Privacy has the nature of being both a common law right as well\nas a fundamental right. Its content, in both forms, is identical. All that\ndiffers is the incidence of burden and the forum for enforcement for each\nform.\n16\nThe Content of the Right of Privacy\n19.     It might be broadly necessary to determine the nature and\ncontent of privacy in order to consider the extent of its constitutional\nprotection. As in the case of ‘life’ under\nArticle 21\n, a precise definition of\nthe term ‘privacy’ may not be possible. This difficulty need not detain us.\nDefinitional and boundary-setting challenges are not unique to the rights\nguaranteed in\nArticle 21.\nThis feature is integral to many core rights,\nsuch as the right to equality. Evidently, the expansive character of any\nright central to constitutional democracies like ours has nowhere stood in\nthe way of recognizing a right and treating it as fundamental where there\nare strong constitutional grounds on which to do so.\n20.     The existence of zones of privacy is felt instinctively by all\ncivilized people, without exception. The best evidence for this proposition\nlies in the panoply of activities through which we all express claims to\nprivacy in our daily lives. We lock our doors, clothe our bodies and set\npasswords to our computers and phones to signal that we intend for our\nplaces, persons and virtual lives to be private. An early case in the\n17\nSupreme Court of Georgia in the United States describes the natural and\ninstinctive recognition of the need for privacy in the following terms:\n“The right of privacy has its foundation in the\ninstincts of nature. It is recognized intuitively,\nconsciousness being the witness that can be called to\nestablish its existence. Any person whose intellect is\nin a normal condition recognizes at once that as to\neach individual member of society there are matters\nprivate and there are matters public so far as the\nindividual    is  concerned.   Each   individual   as\ninstinctively resents any encroachment by the public\nupon his rights which are of a private nature as he\ndoes the withdrawal of those of his rights which are\nof a public nature22”.\nThe same instinctive resentment is evident in the present day as well.\nFor instance, the non-consensual revelation of personal information such\nas the state of one’s health, finances, place of residence, location, daily\nroutines and so on efface one’s sense of personal and financial security.\nIn\nDistrict Registrar and Collector v. Canara Bank23\n, this Court observed\nwhat the jarring reality of a lack of privacy may entail:\n“ ...If the right is to be held to be not attached to\nthe person, then “we would not shield our account\nbalances, income figures and personal telephone and\naddress books from the public eye, but might instead\ngo about with the information written on our\n‘foreheads or our bumper stickers’. ”\n22\nPavesich v. New England Life Insurance co. et al., 50 S.E. 68 (Supreme Court of Georgia)\n23\n(2005) 1 SCC 496 at 48\n18\n21.      ‘Privacy’ is “[t]he condition or state of being free from public\nattention to intrusion into or interference with one’s acts or decisions”24.\nThe right to be in this condition has been described as ‘the right to be let\nalone’25. What seems to be essential to privacy is the power to seclude\noneself and keep others from intruding it in any way. These intrusions\nmay be physical or visual, and may take any of several forms including\npeeping over one’s shoulder to eavesdropping directly or through\ninstruments, devices or technological aids.\n22.     Every individual is entitled to perform his actions in private. In\nother words, she is entitled to be in a state of repose and to work\nwithout being disturbed, or otherwise observed or spied upon. The\nentitlement to such a condition is not confined only to intimate spaces\nsuch as the bedroom or the washroom but goes with a person wherever\nhe is, even in a public place. Privacy has a deep affinity with seclusion\n(of our physical persons and things) as well as such ideas as repose,\nsolitude, confidentiality and secrecy (in our communications), and\n24\nBLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (Bryan Garner, ed.) 3783 (2004)\n25\nSamuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, The Right To Privacy, 4 HARV. L. REV. 193\n(1890)\n19\nintimacy. But this is not to suggest that solitude is always essential to\nprivacy. It is in this sense of an individual’s liberty to do things privately\nthat a group of individuals, however large, is entitled to seclude itself\nfrom others and be private. In fact, a conglomeration of individuals in a\nspace to which the rights of admission are reserved – as in a hotel or a\ncinema hall –must be regarded as private. Nor is the right to privacy lost\nwhen a person moves about in public. The law requires a specific\nauthorization for search of a person even where there is suspicion26.\nPrivacy must also mean the effective guarantee of a zone of internal\nfreedom in which to think. The disconcerting effect of having another\npeer over one’s shoulder while reading or writing explains why\nindividuals would choose to retain their privacy even in public. It is\nimportant to be able to keep one’s work without publishing it in a\ncondition which may be described as private. The vigour and vitality of\nthe various expressive freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution depends\non the existence of a corresponding guarantee of cognitive freedom.\n26\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985\n, s. 42\n20\n23.      Even in the ancient and religious texts of India, a well-developed\nsense of privacy is evident. A woman ought not to be seen by a male\nstranger seems to be a well-established rule in the Ramayana. Grihya\nSutras prescribe the manner in which one ought to build one’s house in\norder to protect the privacy of its inmates and preserve its sanctity\nduring the performance of religious rites, or when studying the Vedas or\ntaking meals. The Arthashastra prohibits entry into another’s house,\nwithout the owner’s consent27. There is still a denomination known as\nthe Ramanuj Sampradaya in southern India, members of which continue\nto observe the practice of not eating and drinking in the presence of\nanyone else. Similarly in Islam, peeping into others’ houses is strictly\nprohibited28.    Just as the United States Fourth Amendment guarantees\nprivacy in one’s papers and personal effects, the Hadith makes it\nreprehensible to read correspondence between others. In Christianity,\nwe find the aspiration to live without interfering in the affairs of others in\nthe text of the Bible29. Confession of one’s sins is a private act30.\n27\nKAUTILYA’S ARTHASHASTRA189-90 (R. Shamasastri, trans., 1915)\n28\nAA MAUDUDI , HUMAN RIGHTS IN ISLAM 27 (1982)\n29\nThessalonians 4:11 THE BIBLE\n21\nReligious     and     social     customs   affirming   privacy     also   find\nacknowledgement in our laws, for example, in the Civil Procedure Code’s\nexemption of a pardanashin lady’s appearance in Court31.\n24.       Privacy, that is to say, the condition arrived at after excluding\nother persons, is a basic pre-requisite for exercising the liberty and the\nfreedom to perform that activity. The inability to create a condition of\nselective seclusion virtually denies an individual the freedom to exercise\nthat particular liberty or freedom necessary to do that activity.\n25.       It is not possible to truncate or isolate the basic freedom to do\nan activity in seclusion from the freedom to do the activity itself. The\nright to claim a basic condition like privacy in which guaranteed\nfundamental rights can be exercised must itself be regarded as a\nfundamental right. Privacy, thus, constitutes the basic, irreducible\ncondition necessary for the exercise of ‘personal liberty’ and freedoms\nguaranteed by the Constitution. It is the inarticulate major premise in\nPart III of the Constitution.\n30\nJames 5:16 THE BIBLE\n31\nCode of Civil Procedure\n, 1989, S. 132\n22\nPrivacy’s Connection to Dignity and Liberty\n26.      Undoubtedly, privacy exists, as the foregoing demonstrates, as a\nverifiable fact in all civilized societies. But privacy does not stop at being\nmerely a descriptive claim. It also embodies a normative one. The\nnormative case for privacy is intuitively simple. Nature has clothed man,\namongst other things, with dignity and liberty so that he may be free to\ndo what he will consistent with the freedom of another and to develop his\nfaculties to the fullest measure necessary to live in happiness and peace.\nThe Constitution, through its Part III, enumerates many of these\nfreedoms and their corresponding rights as fundamental rights. Privacy is\nan essential condition for the exercise of most of these freedoms.\nEx facie, every right which is integral to the constitutional rights to\ndignity, life, personal liberty and freedom, as indeed the right to privacy\nis, must itself be regarded as a fundamental right.\n27.      Though he did not use the name of ‘privacy’, it is clear that it is\nwhat J.S. Mill took to be indispensable to the existence of the general\nreservoir of liberty that democracies are expected to reserve to their\n23\ncitizens. In the introduction to his seminal On Liberty (1859), he\ncharacterized freedom in the following way:\n“This, then, is the appropriate region of human\nliberty. It comprises, first, the inward domain\nof    consciousness;        demanding       liberty    of\nconscience, in the most comprehensive sense;\nliberty of thought and feeling; absolute\nfreedom of opinion and sentiment on all\nsubjects, practical or speculative, scientific,\nmoral, or theological. The liberty of expressing\nand publishing opinions may seem to fall under a\ndifferent principle, since it belongs to that part of the\nconduct of an individual which concerns other\npeople; but, being almost of as much importance as\nthe liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part\non the same reasons, is practically inseparable from\nit. Secondly, the principle requires liberty of\ntastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our\nlife to suit our own character; of doing as we like,\nsubject to such consequences as may follow: without\nimpediment from our fellow-creatures, so long as\nwhat we do does not harm them, even though they\nshould think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong.\nThirdly, from this liberty of each individual, follows\nthe liberty, within the same limits, of combination\namong individuals; freedom to unite, for any purpose\nnot involving harm to others: the persons combining\nbeing supposed to be of full age, and not forced or\ndeceived.\nNo society in which these liberties are not, on\nthe whole, respected, is free, whatever may be\nits form of government; and none is completely\nfree in which they do not exist absolute and\nunqualified. The only freedom which deserves\nthe name, is that of pursuing our own good in\nour own way, so long as we do not attempt to\ndeprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts\nto obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his\nown health, whether bodily, or mental and\nspiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering\n24\neach other to live as seems good to themselves,\nthan by compelling each to live as seems good to the\nrest.\nThough this doctrine is anything but new, and, to\nsome persons, may have the air of a truism, there is\nno doctrine which stands more directly opposed to\nthe general tendency of existing opinion and\npractice. Society has expended fully as much effort\nin the attempt (according to its lights) to compel\npeople to conform to its notions of personal, as of\nsocial excellence.”32 (Emphasis supplied)\n28.     The first and natural home for a right of privacy is in\nArticle 21\nat the very heart of ‘personal liberty’ and life itself. Liberty and privacy\nare integrally connected in a way that privacy is often the basic condition\nnecessary for exercise of the right of personal liberty. There are\ninnumerable activities which are virtually incapable of being performed at\nall and in many cases with dignity unless an individual is left alone or is\notherwise empowered to ensure his or her privacy. Birth and death are\nevents when privacy is required for ensuring dignity amongst all civilized\npeople. Privacy is thus one of those rights “instrumentally required if one\nis to enjoy”33 rights specified and enumerated in the constitutional text.\n32\nJOHN STUART MILL, ON LIBERTY AND OTHER ESSAYS 15-16 (Stefan Collini ed., 1989) (1859)\n33\nLaurence H. Tribe and Michael C. Dorf, Levels Of Generality In The Definition Of Rights,\n57 U. CHI . L. REV. 1057 (1990) at 1068\n25\n29.       This Court has endorsed the view that ‘life’ must mean\n“something more than mere animal existence”34 on a number of\noccasions, beginning with the Constitution Bench in\nSunil Batra (I) v.\nDelhi Administration35\n. Sunil Batra connected this view of\nArticle 21\nto\nthe constitutional value of dignity.\nIn numerous cases, including\nFrancis\nCoralie Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi36\n, this Court has\nviewed liberty as closely linked to dignity. Their relationship to the effect\nof taking into the protection of ‘life’ the protection of “faculties of\nthinking and feeling”, and of temporary and permanent impairments to\nthose faculties. In Francis Coralie Mullin, Bhagwati, J. opined as\nfollows37:\n“Now obviously, the right to life enshrined in\nArticle\n21\ncannot be restricted to mere animal existence. It\nmeans something much more than just physical\nsurvival. In Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh,\nSubba Rao J. quoted with approval the following\npassage from the judgment of Field J. in Munn v.\nIllinois to emphasize the quality of life covered by\nArticle 21:\n“By the term “life” as here used something more is\nmeant than mere animal existence.

Illinois, (1877) 94 US 113 (Per Field, J.) as cited In Kharak Singh at p. 347-8\n35\n(1978) 4 SCC 494\n36\n(1981) 1 SCC 608\n37\nFrancis Coralie Mullin at 7\n26\nagainst its deprivation extends to all those limbs and\nfaculties by which life is enjoyed.\nThe provision\nequally prohibits the mutilation of the body or\namputation of an arm or leg or the putting out of an\neye or the destruction of any other organ of the body\nthrough which the soul communicates with the outer\nworld.”\nand this passage was again accepted as laying down\nthe correct law by the Constitution Bench of this\nCourt in the first\nSunil Batra\ncase (supra). Every\nlimb or faculty through which life is enjoyed is\nthus protected by\nArticle 21\nand a fortiori, this\nwould include the faculties of thinking and\nfeeling. Now deprivation which is inhibited by\nArticle\n21\nmay be total or partial, neither any limb or faculty\ncan be totally destroyed nor can it be partially\ndamaged. Moreover it is every kind of deprivation\nthat is hit by\nArticle 21\n, whether such deprivation be\npermanent        or    temporary    and,    furthermore,\ndeprivation is not an act which is complete once and\nfor all: it is a continuing act and so long as it lasts, it\nmust be in accordance with procedure established by\nlaw. It is therefore clear that any act which\ndamages or injures or interferes with the use\nof, any limb or faculty of a person, either\npermanently or even temporarily, would be\nwithin        the    inhibition    of    Article     21.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\nPrivacy is therefore necessary in both its mental and physical aspects as\nan enabler of guaranteed freedoms.\n30.     It is difficult to   see how dignity        – whose constitutional\nsignificance is acknowledged both by the Preamble and by this Court in\nits exposition of\nArticle 21\n, among other rights – can be assured to the\n27\nindividual without privacy. Both dignity and privacy are intimately\nintertwined and are natural conditions for the birth and death of\nindividuals, and for many significant events in life between these events.\nNecessarily, then, the right of privacy is an integral part of both ‘life’ and\n‘personal liberty’ under\nArticle 21\n, and is intended to enable the rights\nbearer to develop her potential to the fullest extent made possible only\nin consonance with the constitutional values expressed in the Preamble\nas well as across Part III.\nPrivacy as a Travelling Right\n31.     I have already shown that the right of privacy is as inalienable as\nthe right to perform any constitutionally permissible act. Privacy in all its\naspects constitutes the springboard for the exercise of the freedoms\nguaranteed by\nArticle 19(1).\nFreedom of speech and expression is always\ndependent on the capacity to think, read and write in private and is often\nexercised in a state of privacy, to the exclusion of those not intended to\nbe spoken to or communicated with. A peaceful assembly requires the\nexclusion of elements who may not be peaceful or who may have a\ndifferent agenda. The freedom to associate must necessarily be the\n28\nfreedom to associate with those of one’s choice and those with common\nobjectives. The requirement of privacy in matters concerning residence\nand settlement is too well-known to require elaboration. Finally, it is not\npossible to conceive of an individual being able to practice a profession\nor carry on trade, business or occupation without the right to privacy in\npractical terms and without the right and power to keep others away\nfrom his work.\n32.     Ex facie, privacy is essential to the exercise of freedom of\nconscience and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion vide\nArticle 25.\nThe further right of every religious denomination to maintain\ninstitutions for religious and charitable purposes, to manage its own\naffairs and to own and administer property acquired for such purposes\nvide\nArticle 26\nalso requires privacy, in the sense of non-interference\nfrom the state.\nArticle 28(3)\nexpressly recognizes the right of a student\nattending an educational institution recognized by the state, to be left\nalone. Such a student cannot be compelled to take part in any religious\ninstruction imparted in any such institution unless his guardian has\nconsented to it.\n29\n33.     The right of privacy is also integral to the cultural and\neducational rights whereby a group having a distinct language, script or\nculture shall have the right to conserve the same. It has also always\nbeen an integral part of the right to own property and has been treated\nas such in civil law as well as in criminal law vide all the offences and\ntorts of trespass known to law.\n34.     Therefore, privacy is the necessary condition precedent to the\nenjoyment of any of the guarantees in Part III. As a result, when it is\nclaimed by rights bearers before constitutional courts, a right to privacy\nmay be situated not only in\nArticle 21\n, but also simultaneously in any of\nthe other guarantees in Part III. In the current state of things,\nArticles\n19(1)\n, 20(3)\n, 25\n, 28\nand\n29\nare all rights helped up and made\nmeaningful by the exercise of privacy. This is not an exhaustive list.\nFuture developments in technology and social ordering may well reveal\nthat there are yet more constitutional sites in which a privacy right\ninheres that are not at present evident to us.\n30\nJudicial Enumeration of the Fundamental Right to Privacy\n35.      There is nothing unusual in the judicial enumeration of one right\non the basis of another under the Constitution. In the case of Article 21’s\nguarantee of ‘personal liberty’, this practice is only natural if Salmond’s\nformulation of liberty as “incipient rights”38 is correct. By the process of\nenumeration, constitutional courts merely give a name and specify the\ncore of guarantees already present in the residue of constitutional\nliberty. Over time, the Supreme Court has been able to imply by its\ninterpretative process, that several fundamental rights including the right\nto privacy emerge out of expressly stated Fundamental Rights.\nIn\nUnni\nKrishnan, J.P. v. State of A.P.39\n, a Constitution Bench of this Court held\nthat “several unenumerated rights fall within\nArticle 21\nsince personal\nliberty is of widest amplitude”40 on the way to affirming the existence of\na right to education. It went on to supply the following indicative list of\nsuch rights, which included the right to privacy:\n“30. The following rights are held to be covered\nunder\nArticle 21:\n38\nSALMOND, at p. 228\n39\n(1993) SCC 1 645\n40\nId. at 29\n31\n1. The right to go abroad.\nSatwant Singh v. D.\nRamarathnam A.P.

Totame\n,\n(1990) 1 SCC 520”\nIn the case of privacy, the case for judicial enumeration is especially\nstrong. It is no doubt a fair implication from\nArticle 21\n, but also more.\nPrivacy is be a right or condition, “logically presupposed”41 by rights\nexpressly recorded in the constitutional text, if they are to make sense.\n41\nLaurence H. Tribe And Michael C. Dorf, Levels Of Generality In The Definition Of\nRights, 57 U. CHI. L. REV. 1057 (1990) at p. 1068\n32\nAs a result, privacy is more than merely a derivative constitutional right.\nIt is the necessary and unavoidable logical entailment of rights\nguaranteed in the text of the constitution.\n36.     Not recognizing character of privacy as a fundamental right is\nlikely to erode the very sub-stratum of the personal liberty guaranteed\nby the constitution. The decided cases clearly demonstrate that\nparticular fundamental rights could not have been exercised without the\nrecognition of the right of privacy as a fundamental right. Any\nderecognition or diminution in the importance of the right of privacy will\nweaken the fundamental rights which have been expressly conferred.\n37.     Before proceeding to the question of how constitutional courts\nare to review whether a violation of privacy is unconstitutional, three\narguments from the Union and the states deserve to be dealt with\nexpressly.\n38.     The Learned Attorney General relied on cases holding that there\nis no fundamental right to trade in liquor to submit by analogy that there\ncan be no absolute right to privacy. Apprehensions that the recognition\nof privacy would create complications for the state in its exercise of\n33\npowers is not well-founded. The declaration of a right cannot be avoided\nwhere there is good constitutional ground for doing so. It is only after\nacknowledging that the right of privacy is a fundamental right, that we\ncan consider how it affects the plenary powers of the state. In any event,\nthe state can always legislate a reasonable restriction to protect and\neffectuate a compelling state interest, like it may while restricting any\nother fundamental right. There is no warrant for the assumption or for\nthe conclusion that the fundamental right to privacy is an absolute right\nwhich cannot be reasonably restricted given a sufficiently compelling\nstate interest.\n39.     Learned Additional Solicitor General, Shri Tushar Mehta listed\ninnumerable statutes which protect the right of privacy wherever\nnecessary and urged that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to\nrecognize privacy as a fundamental right. This argument cannot be\naccepted any more in the context of a fundamental right to privacy than\nin the context of any other fundamental right. Several legislations\nprotect and advance fundamental rights, but their existence does not\nmake the existence of a corresponding fundamental right redundant.\n34\nThis is obviously so because legislations are alterable and even\nrepealable unlike fundamental rights, which, by design, endure.\n40.     Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the State of Gujarat, while\nreferring to several judgments of the Supreme Court of the United\nStates, submitted that only those privacy claims which involve a\n‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ be recognized as protected by the\nfundamental right.   It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to\ndeal with the particular instances of privacy claims which are to be\nrecognized as implicating a fundamental right. Indeed, it would be\npremature to do. The scope and ambit of a constitutional protection of\nprivacy can only be revealed to us on a case-by-case basis.\nThe Test for Privacy\n41.     One way of determining what a core constitutional idea is, could\nbe by considering its opposite, which shows what it is not. Accordingly,\nwe understand justice as the absence of injustice, and freedom as the\nabsence of restraint. So too privacy may be understood as the antonym\nof publicity. In law, the distinction between what is considered a private\ntrust as opposed to a public trust illuminates what I take to be core and\n35\nirreducible attributes of privacy.\nIn\nDeoki Nandan v. Murlidhar42\n, four\njudges of this Court articulated the distinction in the following terms:\n“The distinction between a private trust and a\npublic trust is that whereas in the former the\nbeneficiaries are specific individuals, in the latter\nthey are the general public or a class thereof. While\nin the former the beneficiaries are persons who are\nascertained or capable of being ascertained, in the\nlatter they constitute a body which is incapable of\nascertainment.”\nThis same feature, namely the right of a member of public as such to\nenter upon or use such property, distinguishes private property from\npublic property and private ways from public roads.\n42.      Privacy is always connected, whether directly or through its\neffect on the actions which are sought to be secured from interference,\nto the act of associating with others. In this sense, privacy is usually best\nunderstood as a relational right, even as its content frequently concerns\nthe exclusion of others from one’s society.\n43.      The trusts illustration also offers us a workable test for\ndetermining when a constitutionally cognizable privacy claim has been\nmade, and the basis for acknowledging that the existence of such a claim\n42\n(1956) SCR 756\n36\nis context-dependent. To exercise one’s right to privacy is to choose and\nspecify on two levels. It is to choose which of the various activities that\nare taken in by the general residue of liberty available to her she would\nlike to perform, and to specify whom to include in one’s circle when\nperforming them. It is also autonomy in the negative, and takes in the\nchoice and specification of which activities not to perform and which\npersons to exclude from one’s circle. Exercising privacy is the signaling\nof one’s intent to these specified others – whether they are one’s co-\nparticipants or simply one’s audience – as well as to society at large, to\nclaim and exercise the right. To check for the existence of an actionable\nclaim to privacy, all that needs to be considered is if such an intent to\nchoose and specify exists, whether directly in its manifestation in the\nrights bearer’s actions, or otherwise.\n44.     Such a formulation would exclude three recurring red herrings in\nthe Respondents’ arguments before us. Firstly, it would not admit of\narguments that privacy is limited to property or places. So, for example,\ntaking one or more persons aside to converse at a whisper even in a\npublic place would clearly signal a claim to privacy, just as broadcasting\n37\none’s words by a loudspeaker would signal the opposite intent. Secondly,\nthis formulation would not reduce privacy to solitude. Reserving the\nrights to admission at a large gathering place, such as a cinema hall or\nclub, would signal a claim to privacy. Finally, neither would such a\nformulation require us to hold that private information must be\ninformation that is inaccessible to all others.\nStandards of Review of Privacy Violations\n45.     There is no doubt that privacy is integral to the several\nfundamental rights recognized by Part III of the Constitution and must\nbe regarded as a fundamental right itself. The relationship between the\nright of privacy and the particular fundamental right (or rights) involved\nwould depend on the action interdicted by a particular law. At a\nminimum, since privacy is always integrated with personal liberty, the\nconstitutionality of the law which is alleged to have invaded into a rights\nbearer’s privacy must be tested by the same standards by which a law\nwhich invades personal liberty under\nArticle 21\nis liable to be tested.\nUnder\nArticle 21\n, the standard test at present is the rationality review\nexpressed in Maneka Gandhi’s case. This requires that any procedure by\n38\nwhich the state interferes with an\nArticle 21\nright to be “fair, just and\nreasonable, not fanciful, oppressive or arbitrary”43.\n46.      Once it is established that privacy imbues every constitutional\nfreedom with its efficacy and that it can be located in each of them, it\nmust follow that interference with it by the state must be tested against\nwhichever one or more Part III guarantees whose enjoyment is curtailed.\nAs a result, privacy violations will usually have to answer to tests in\naddition to the one applicable to\nArticle 21.\nSuch a view would be wholly\nconsistent with R.C. Cooper v. Union of India.\nConclusion\n47.      In view of the foregoing, I answer the reference before us in the\nfollowing terms:\na.    The ineluctable conclusion must be that an inalienable\nconstitutional right to privacy inheres in Part III of the\nConstitution. M.P. Sharma and the majority opinion in Kharak\nSingh must stand overruled to the extent that they indicate to\nthe contrary.\n43\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n(1978) 1 SCC 248 at para 48\n39\nb.    The right to privacy is inextricably bound up with all\nexercises of human liberty – both as it is specifically enumerated\nacross Part III, and as it is guaranteed in the residue under\nArticle 21.\nIt is distributed across the various articles in Part III\nand, mutatis mutandis, takes the form of whichever of their\nenjoyment its violation curtails.\nc.    Any interference with privacy by an entity covered by\nArticle 12’s description of the ‘state’ must satisfy the tests\napplicable to whichever one or more of the Part III freedoms the\ninterference affects.\n.................................

Nariman, J.\nPrologue\n1.   The importance of the present matter is such that\nwhichever way it is decided, it will have huge repercussions for\nthe democratic republic that we call “Bharat” i.e. India. A Bench\nof 9-Judges has been constituted to look into questions relating\nto basic human rights. A 3-Judge Bench of this Court was\ndealing with a scheme propounded by the Government of India\npopularly known as the Aadhar card scheme. Under the said\nscheme, the Government of India collects and compiles both\ndemographic and biometric data of the residents of this country\nto be used for various purposes. One of the grounds of attack\non the said scheme is that the very collection of such data is\nviolative of the “Right to Privacy”. After hearing the learned\nAttorney General, Shri Gopal Subramanium and Shri Shyam\nDivan, a 3-Judge Bench opined as follows:\n“12. We are of the opinion that the cases on hand\nraise far reaching questions of importance involving\ninterpretation of the Constitution. What is at stake is\nthe amplitude of the fundamental rights including\n3\nthat precious and inalienable right under\nArticle 21.\nIf the observations made in M.P. Sharma (supra)\nand Kharak Singh (supra) are to be read literally\nand accepted as the law of this country, the\nfundamental      rights   guaranteed     under    the\nConstitution of India and more particularly right to\nliberty under\nArticle 21\nwould be denuded of vigour\nand vitality. At the same time, we are also of the\nopinion that the institutional integrity and judicial\ndiscipline require that pronouncement made by\nlarger Benches of this Court cannot be ignored by\nthe smaller Benches without appropriately\nexplaining the reasons for not following the\npronouncements made by such larger Benches.\nWith due respect to all the learned Judges who\nrendered the subsequent judgments—where right to\nprivacy is asserted or referred to their Lordships\nconcern for the liberty of human beings, we are of\nthe humble opinion that there appears to be certain\namount of apparent unresolved contradiction in the\nlaw declared by this Court.\n13. Therefore, in our opinion to give a quietus to the\nkind of controversy raised in this batch of cases\nonce for all, it is better that the ratio decidendi of\nM.P. Sharma (supra) and Kharak Singh (supra) is\nscrutinized and the jurisprudential correctness of the\nsubsequent decisions of this Court where the right\nto privacy is either asserted or referred be examined\nand authoritatively decided by a Bench of\nappropriate strength.”\n2.   The matter was heard by a Bench of 5 learned Judges on\nJuly 18, 2017, and was thereafter referred to 9 learned Judges\nin view of the fact that the judgment in\nM.P. Sharma and\nothers v. Satish Chandra, District Magistrate, Delhi, and\n4\nothers\n, 1954 SCR 1077, was by a Bench of 8 learned Judges\nof this Court.\n3.    Learned senior counsel for the petitioners, Shri Gopal\nSubramanium, Shri Shyam Divan, Shri Arvind Datar, Shri Sajan\nPoovayya, Shri Anand Grover and Miss Meenakshi Arora, have\nargued that the judgments contained in M.P. Sharma (supra)\nand\nKharak Singh v. State of U.P.\n, (1964) 1 SCR 332, which\nwas by a Bench of 6 learned Judges, should be overruled as\nthey do not reflect the correct position in law.\nIn any case, both\njudgments have been overtaken by R.C. Cooper v. Union of\nIndia, (\n1970) 1 SCC 248, and Maneka Gandhi v. Union of\nIndia\n, (1978) 1 SCC 248, and therefore require a revisit at our\nend. According to them, the right to privacy is very much a\nfundamental right which is co-terminus with the liberty and\ndignity of the individual. According to them, this right is found in\nArticles 14\n, 19\n, 20\n, 21\nand\n25\nwhen read with the Preamble of\nthe Constitution. Further, it was also argued that several\ninternational covenants have stated that the right to privacy is\nfundamental to the development of the human personality and\nthat these international covenants need to be read into the\n5\nfundamental rights chapter of the Constitution. Also, according\nto them, the right to privacy should be evolved on a case to\ncase basis, and being a fundamental human right should only\nyield to State action if such State action is compelling,\nnecessary and in public interest. A large number of judgments\nwere cited by all of them. They also invited this Court to\npronounce upon the fact that the right to privacy is an\ninalienable natural right which is not conferred by the\nConstitution but only recognized as such.\n4.   Shri Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel on behalf of the\nStates of Karnataka, West Bengal, Punjab and Puducherry\nbroadly supported the petitioners.   According to him, the 8-\nJudge Bench and the 6-Judge Bench decisions have ceased to\nbe relevant in the context of the vastly changed circumstances\nof today. Further, according to him, State action that violates\nthe fundamental right to privacy must contain at least four\nelements, namely:\n•     “The action must be sanctioned by law;\n•     The proposed action must be necessary in a\ndemocratic society for a legitimate aim;\n6\n•     The extent of such interference must be\nproportionate to the need for such\ninterference;\n•     There must be procedural guarantees against\nabuse of such interference.”\n5.    Shri P.V. Surendra Nath, appearing on behalf of the State\nof Kerala, also supported the petitioners and stated that the\nconstitutional right to privacy very much exists in Part III of the\nConstitution.\n6.    Appearing on behalf of the Union of India, Shri K.K.\nVenugopal, learned Attorney General for India, has argued that\nthe conclusions arrived at in the 8-Judge Bench and the 6-\nJudge Bench decisions should not be disturbed as they are\nsupported by the fact that the founding fathers expressly\nrejected the right to privacy being made part of the fundamental\nrights chapter of the Constitution. He referred in copious detail\nto the Constituent Assembly debates for this purpose. Further,\naccording to him, privacy is a common law right and all aspects\nof privacy do not elevate themselves into being a fundamental\nright. If at all, the right to privacy can only be one amongst\n7\nseveral varied rights falling under the umbrella of the right to\npersonal liberty. According to him, the right to life stands above\nthe right to personal liberty, and any claim to privacy which\nwould destroy or erode this basic foundational right can never\nbe elevated to the status of a fundamental right.        He also\nargued that the right to privacy cannot be claimed when most of\nthe aspects which are sought to be protected by such right are\nalready in the public domain and the information in question\nhas already been parted with by citizens.\n7.   Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor General of\nIndia, appearing for UIDAI and the State of Madhya Pradesh,\ngenerally supported and adopted the arguments of the learned\nAttorney General. According to him, privacy is an inherently\nvague and subjective concept and cannot, therefore, be\naccorded the status of a fundamental right. Further, codified\nstatutory law in India already confers protection to the\nindividual’s right to privacy.   According to him, no further\nexpansion of the rights contained in Part III of our Constitution\nis at all warranted. Also, the position under English Law is that\nthere is no common law right to privacy. He cited before us\n8\nexamples of other countries in the world where privacy is\nprotected by legislation and not by or under the Constitution.\n8.     Shri Aryama Sundaram, appearing for the State of\nMaharashtra, also supported the arguments made by the\nlearned Attorney General.        According to him, there is no\nseparate “privacy” right and violation of a fundamental right\nshould directly be traceable to rights expressly protected by\nPart III of the Constitution. Further, privacy is a vague and\ninchoate expression.       He also referred to the Constituent\nAssembly debates to buttress the same proposition that the\nright to privacy was expressly discountenanced by the framers\nof the Constitution.    He went on to state that “personal liberty”\nin\nArticle 21\nis liberty which is circumscribed – i.e. it relates only\nto the person of the individual and is smaller conceptually than\n“civil liberty”.   According to him, the ratio of Kharak Singh\n(supra) is that there is no fundamental right to privacy, but any\nfundamental right that is basic to ordered liberty would certainly\nbe included as a fundamental right.\nAccording to him,\nGobind\nv. State of Madhya Pradesh\n, (1975) 2 SCC 148, did not state\nthat there was any fundamental right to privacy and the later\n9\njudgments which referred only to\nGobind\n(supra) as laying\ndown such a right are incorrect for this reason.\n9.   Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel appearing\nfor the State of Gujarat, has argued that both the petitioners as\nwell as the learned Attorney General have taken extreme\npositions. According to him, the petitioners state that in the\ncase of every invasion of a privacy right, howsoever trivial, the\nfundamental right to privacy gets attracted, whereas according\nto the learned Attorney General, there is no fundamental right\nto privacy at all. He asked us to adopt an intermediate position\n– namely, that it is only if the U.S. Supreme Court’s standard\nthat a petitioner before a Court satisfies the test of “reasonable\nexpectation of privacy” that such infraction of privacy can be\nelevated to the level of a fundamental right. According to Shri\nDwivedi, individual personal choices made by an individual are\nalready protected under\nArticle 21\nunder the rubric “personal\nliberty”. It is only when individuals disclose certain personal\ninformation in order to avail a benefit that it could be said that\nthey have no reasonable expectation of privacy as they have\nvoluntarily and freely parted with such information. Also,\n10\naccording to him, it is only specialized data, if parted with,\nwhich would require protection. As an example, he stated that\na person’s name and mobile number, already being in the\npublic domain, would not be reasonably expected by that\nperson to be something private. On the other hand, what is\ncontained in that person’s bank account could perhaps be\nstated to be information over which he expects a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy and would, if divulged by the bank to\nothers, constitute an infraction of his fundamental right to\nprivacy. According to him:\n“…when a claim of privacy seeks inclusion in\nArticle\n21\nof the Constitution of India, the Court needs to\napply the reasonable expectation of privacy test. It\nshould see:–\n(i)     What is the context in which a privacy law is\nset up.\n(ii)    Does the claim relate to private or family life,\nor a confidential relationship.\n(iii)   Is the claim serious one or is it trivial.\n(iv)    Is the disclosure likely to result in any serious\nor significant injury and the nature and the\nextent of disclosure.\n(v)     Is disclosure for identification purpose or\nrelates to personal and sensitive information\nof an identified person.\n11\n(vi)    Does disclosure relate to information already\ndisclosed publicly to third parties or several\nparties willingly and unconditionally. Is the\ndisclosure in the course of e commerce or\nsocial media?\nAssuming, that in a case that it is found that a claim\nfor privacy is protected by\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution, the test should be following:-\n(i)     the infringement should be by legislation.\n(ii)    the legislation should be in public interest.\n(iii)   the legislation should be reasonable and have\nnexus with the public interest.\n(iv)    the State would be entitled to adopt that\nmeasure which would most efficiently achieve\nthe objective without being excessive.\n(v)     if apart from\nArticle 21\n, the legislation infringes\nany other specified Fundamental Right then it\nmust stand the test in relation to that specified\nFundamental Right.\n(vi)    Presumption of validity would attach to the\nlegislations.”\n10.   Shri A. Sengupta, appearing on behalf of the State of\nHaryana, has supported the arguments of the learned Attorney\nGeneral and has gone on to state that even the U.S. Supreme\nCourt no longer uses the right to privacy to test laws that were\nearlier tested on this ground. Any right to privacy is\n12\nconceptually unsound, and only comprehensive data protection\nlegislation can effectively address concerns of data protection\nand privacy. The Government of India is indeed alive to the\nneed for such a law. He further argued that privacy as a\nconcept is always marshaled to protect liberty and, therefore,\nargued that the formulation that should be made by this Court is\nwhether a liberty interest is at all affected; is such liberty\n“personal liberty” or other liberty that deserves constitutional\nprotection and is there a countervailing legitimate State interest.\n11.   Shri Jugal Kishore, appearing on behalf of the State of\nChhattisgarh, has also broadly supported the stand of the\nlearned Attorney General.\n12.   Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing on behalf of the\nCentre for Civil Society, argued that M.P. Sharma (supra) and\nKharak Singh (supra) are correctly decided and must be\nfollowed as there has been no change in the constitutional\ncontext of privacy from\nGopalan\n(supra) through R.C. Cooper\n(supra) and Maneka Gandhi (supra). He further argued that\nbeing incapable of precise definition, privacy ought not to be\n13\nelevated in all its aspects to the level of a fundamental right.\nAccording to him, the words “life” and “personal liberty” in\nArticle 21\nhave already been widely interpreted to include many\nfacets of what the petitioners refer to as privacy. Those facets\nwhich have statutory protection are not protected by\nArticle 21.\nHe also argued that we must never forget that when\nrecognizing aspects of the right to privacy as a fundamental\nright, such aspects cannot be waived and this being the case, a\nprivacy interest ought not to be raised to the level of a\nfundamental right. He also cautioned us against importing\napproaches from overseas out of context.\nEarly Views on Privacy\n13.   Any discussion with regard to a right of privacy of the\nindividual must necessarily begin with Semayne’s case, 77 ER\n194. This case was decided in the year 1603, when there was a\nchange of guard in England. The Tudor dynasty ended with the\ndeath of Elizabeth I, and the Stuart dynasty, a dynasty which\nhailed from Scotland took over under James VI of Scotland,\n14\nwho became James I of England.1 James I was an absolute\nmonarch who ruled believing that he did so by Divine Right.\nSemayne’s case (supra) was decided in this historical setting.\n14.      The importance of Semayne’s case (supra) is that it\ndecided that every man’s home is his castle and fortress for his\ndefence against injury and violence, as well as for his repose.\nWilliam Pitt, the Elder, put it thus: “The poorest man may in his\ncottage bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail\n— its roof may shake — the wind may blow through it — the\nstorm may enter, the rain may enter — but the King of England\ncannot enter — all his force dare not cross the threshold of the\nruined tenement.” A century and a half later, pretty much the\nsame thing was said in Huckle v. Money, 95 ER 768 (1763), in\nwhich it was held that Magistrates cannot exercise arbitrary\npowers which violated the Magna Carta (signed by King John,\nconceding certain rights to his barons in 1215), and if they did,\nexemplary damages must be given for the same. It was stated\n1\nIt is interesting to note that from 1066 onwards, England has never been ruled by a native Anglo-Saxon. The\nNorman French dynasty which gave way to the Plantagenet dynasty ruled from 1066-1485; the Welsh Tudor\ndynasty then ruled from 1485-1603 AD; the Stuart dynasty, a Scottish dynasty, then ruled from 1603; and barring a\nminor hiccup in the form of Oliver Cromwell, ruled up to 1714. From 1714 onwards, members of a German dynasty\nfrom Hanover have been monarchs of England and continue to be monarchs in England.\n15\nthat, “To enter a man’s house by virtue of a nameless warrant,\nin order to procure evidence is worse than the Spanish\nInquisition, a law under which no Englishman would wish to live\nan hour.”\n15.   This statement of the law was echoed in Entick v.\nCarrington, 95 ER 807 (1765), in which Lord Camden held that\nan illegal search warrant was “subversive of all the comforts of\nsociety” and the issuance of such a warrant for the seizure of all\nof a man’s papers, and not only those alleged to be criminal in\nnature, was “contrary to the genius of the law of England.” A\nfew years later, in Da Costa v. Jones, 98 ER 1331 (1778), Lord\nMansfield upheld the privacy of a third person when such\nprivacy was the subject matter of a wager, which was injurious\nto the reputation of such third person. The wager in that case\nwas as to whether a certain Chevalier D’eon was a cheat and\nimposter in that he was actually a woman. Such wager which\nviolated the privacy of a third person was held to be injurious to\nthe reputation of the third person for which damages were\nawarded to the third person. These early judgments did much\nto uphold the inviolability of the person of a citizen.\n16\n16.   When we cross the Atlantic Ocean and go to the United\nStates, we find a very interesting article printed in the Harvard\nLaw Review in 1890 by Samuel D. Warren and Louis D.\nBrandeis [(4 Harv. L. Rev. 193)]. The opening paragraph of the\nsaid article is worth quoting:\n“THAT the individual shall have full protection in\nperson and in property is a principle as old as the\ncommon law; but it has been found necessary from\ntime to time to define anew the exact nature and\nextent of such protection. Political, social, and\neconomic changes entail the recognition of new\nrights, and the common law, in its eternal youth,\ngrows to meet the demands of society. Thus, in very\nearly times, the law gave a remedy only for physical\ninterference with life and property, for trespasses vi\net armis. Then the “right to life” served only to\nprotect the subject from battery in its various forms;\nliberty meant freedom from actual restraint; and the\nright to property secured to the individual his lands\nand his cattle. Later, there came a recognition of\nman’s spiritual nature, of his feelings and his\nintellect. Gradually the scope of these legal rights\nbroadened; and now the right to life has come to\nmean the right to enjoy life,— the right to be let\nalone; the right to liberty secures the exercise of\nextensive civil privileges; and the term “property”\nhas grown to comprise every form of possession—\nintangible, as well as tangible.”\n17.   This article is of great importance for the reason that it\nspoke of the right of the individual “to be let alone”. It stated in\nunmistakable terms that this right is not grounded as a property\n17\nright, but is grounded in having the right of an “inviolate\npersonality”. Limitations on this right were also discussed in\nsome detail, and remedies for the invasion of this right of\nprivacy were suggested, being an action of tort for damages in\nall cases and perhaps an injunction in some. The right of\nprivacy as expounded in this article did not explore the\nramifications of the said right as against State action, but only\nexplored invasions of this right by private persons.\nThree Great Dissents\n18.   When the Constitution of India was framed, the\nfundamental rights chapter consisted of rights essentially of\ncitizens and persons against the State.\nArticle 21\n, with which\nwe are directly concerned, was couched in negative form in\norder to interdict State action that fell afoul of its contours. This\nArticle, which houses two great human rights, the right to life\nand the right to personal liberty, was construed rather narrowly\nby the early Supreme Court of India. But then, there were\nJudges who had vision and dissented from their colleagues.\nThis judgment will refer to three great dissents by Justices Fazl\nAli, Subba Rao and Khanna.\n18\n19.      Charles Evans Hughes, before he became the Chief\nJustice of the United States and while he was still a member of\nthe New York Court of Appeals, delivered a set of six lectures\nat Columbia University.2 The famous passage oft quoted in\nmany judgments comes from his second lecture. In words that\nresonate even today, he stated:\n“A dissent in a court of last resort is an appeal to the\nbrooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of a\nfuture day, when a later decision may possibly\ncorrect the error into which the dissenting judge\nbelieves the court to have been betrayed…..”\n20.      Brandeis, J. had a somewhat different view. He cautioned\nthat “in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule\nof law be settled than that it be settled right.” [See Burnet v.\nCoronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393 at 406 (1932)]. John\nP. Frank wrote, in 1958, of the Brandeis view as follows:\n“Brandeis was a great institutional man. He realized\nthat …. random dissents …. weaken the institutional\nimpact of the Court and handicap it in the doing of\nits fundamental job. Dissents …. need to be saved\nfor major matters if the Court is not to appear\nindecisive and quarrelsome….. To have discarded\nsome of his separate opinions is a supreme\nexample of Brandeis’s sacrifice to the strength and\nconsistency of the Court. And he had his reward:\n2\nSee, E. Gaffney Jr., “The Importance of Dissent and the Imperative of Judicial Civility” (1994) 28 Val. U.L. Rev 583.\n19\nhis shots were all the harder because he chose his\nground.”3\n21.      Whichever way one looks at it, the foresight of Fazl Ali, J.\nin\nA.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras\n, 1950 SCR 88, simply\ntakes our breath away. The subject matter of challenge in the\nsaid case was the validity of certain provisions of the\nPreventive\nDetention Act\nof 1950. In a judgment which anticipated the\nchanges made in our constitutional law twenty years later, this\ngreat Judge said:\n“To my mind, the scheme of the Chapter dealing\nwith the fundamental rights does not contemplate\nwhat is attributed to it, namely, that each article is a\ncode by itself and is independent of the others. In\nmy opinion, it cannot be said that\narticles 19\n, 20\n, 21\nand\n22\ndo not to some extent overlap each other.\nThe case of a person who is convicted of an offence\nwill come under\narticles 20\nand\n21\nand also under\narticle 22\nso far as his arrest and detention in\ncustody before trial are concerned. Preventive\ndetention, which is dealt with in\narticle 22\n, also\namounts to deprivation of personal liberty which is\nreferred to in\narticle 21\n, and is a violation of the right\nof freedom of movement dealt with in\narticle\n19(1)(d).\nThat there are other instances of\noverlapping of articles in the Constitution may be\nillustrated by reference to\narticle 19(1)(f)\nand\narticle\n31\nboth of which deal with the right to property and\nto some extent overlap each other.”\n(at page 148)\n3\nJohn P. Frank, Book Review, 10 J. Legal Education 401, 404 (1958).\n20\nHe went on thereafter to hold that the fact that “due process”\nwas not actually used in\nArticle 21\nwould be of no moment. He\nsaid:\n“It will not be out of place to state here in a few\nwords how the Japanese Constitution came into\nexistence. It appears that on the 11th October,\n1945, General McArthur directed the Japanese\nCabinet to initiate measures for the preparation of\nthe Japanese Constitution, but, as no progress was\nmade, it was decided in February, 1946, that the\nproblem of constitutional reform should be taken\nover by the Government Section of the Supreme\nCommander’s Headquarters. Subsequently the\nChief of this Section and the staff drafted the\nConstitution      with   the    help   of    American\nconstitutional lawyers who were called to assist the\nGovernment Section in the task. This Constitution,\nas a learned writer has remarked, bore on almost\nevery page evidences of its essentially Western\norigin, and this characteristic was especially evident\nin the preamble “particularly reminiscent of the\nAmerican Declaration of Independence, a preamble\nwhich, it has been observed, no Japanese could\npossibly have conceived or written and which few\ncould even understand” [See Ogg and Zink’s\n“Modern Foreign Governments”]. One of the\ncharacteristics      of   the    Constitution   which\nundoubtedly bespeaks of direct American influence\nis to be found in a lengthy chapter, consisting of 31\narticles, entitled “Rights and Duties of the People,”\nwhich provided for the first time an effective “Bill of\nRights” for the Japanese people. The usual\nsafeguards have been provided there against\napprehension without a warrant and against arrest\nor detention without being informed of the charges\nor without adequate cause (\narticles 33\nand\n34\n).\n21\nNow there are two matters which deserve to be\nnoticed:- (1) that the Japanese Constitution was\nframed wholly under American influence; and (2)\nthat at the time it was framed the trend of judicial\nopinion in America was in favour of confining the\nmeaning of the expression “due process of law” to\nwhat is expressed by certain American writers by\nthe somewhat quaint but useful expression\n“procedural due process.” That there was such a\ntrend would be clear from the following passage\nwhich I quote from Carl Brent Swisher’s “The\nGrowth of Constitutional Power in the United States”\n(page 107):-\n“The      American     history   of   its\ninterpretation falls into three periods.\nDuring the first period, covering roughly\nthe first century of government under\nthe Constitution, due process was\ninterpreted principally as a restriction\nupon procedure—and largely the judicial\nprocedure—by which the government\nexercised its powers. During the second\nperiod, which, again roughly speaking,\nextended through 1936, due process\nwas expanded to serve as a restriction\nnot merely upon procedure but upon the\nsubstance of the activities in which the\ngovernment might engage. During the\nthird period, extending from 1936 to\ndate, the use of due process as a\nsubstantive restriction has been largely\nsuspended or abandoned, leaving it\nprincipally in its original status as a\nrestriction upon procedure.”\nIn the circumstances mentioned, it seems\npermissible to surmise that the expression\n“procedure established by law” as used in the\nJapanese Constitution represented the current trend\n22\nof American judicial opinion with regard to “due\nprocess of law,” and, if that is so, the expression as\nused in our Constitution means all that the\nAmerican writers have read into the words\n“procedural due process.” But I do not wish to base\nany conclusions upon mere surmise and will try to\nexamine the whole question on its merits.\nThe word “law” may be used in an abstract or\nconcrete sense. Sometimes it is preceded by an\narticle such as “a” or “the” or by such words as\n“any,” “all,” etc., and sometimes it is used without\nany such prefix. But, generally, the word “law” has a\nwider meaning when used in the abstract sense\nwithout being preceded by an article. The question\nto be decided is whether the word “law” means\nnothing more than statute law.\nNow whatever may be the meaning of the\nexpression “due process of law,” the word “law” is\ncommon to that expression as well as “procedure\nestablished by law” and though we are not bound to\nadopt the construction put on “law” or “due process\nof law” in America, yet since a number of eminent\nAmerican Judges have devoted much thought to the\nsubject, I am not prepared to hold that we can\nderive no help from their opinions and we should\ncompletely ignore them.”\n(at pages 159-161)\nHe also went on to state that “law” in\nArticle 21\nmeans “valid\nlaw”.\nOn all counts, his words were a cry in the wilderness. Insofar\nas his vision that fundamental rights are not in distinct\nwatertight compartments but do overlap, it took twenty years for\n23\nthis Court to realize how correct he was, and in R.C. Cooper\n(supra), an 11-Judge Bench of this Court, agreeing with Fazl\nAli, J., finally held:\n“52. In dealing with the argument that\nArticle\n31(2)\nis a complete code relating to infringement of\nthe right to property by compulsory acquisition, and\nthe validity of the law is not liable to be tested in the\nlight of the reasonableness of the restrictions\nimposed thereby, it is necessary to bear in mind the\nenunciation of the guarantee of fundamental rights\nwhich has taken different forms. In some cases it is\nan express declaration of a guaranteed right:\nArticles 29(1)\n, 30(1)\n, 26\n, 25\n& 32;\nin others to\nensure protection of individual rights they take\nspecific forms of restrictions on State action—\nlegislative or executive—Articles 14, 15, 16, 20, 21,\n22(1), 27 and 28; in some others, it takes the form\nof a positive declaration and simultaneously\nenunciates the restriction thereon:\nArticles 19(1)\nand\n19(2)\nto (6); in some cases, it arises as an\nimplication from the delimitation of the authority of\nthe State, e.g.,\nArticles 31(1)\nand\n31(2);\nin still\nothers, it takes the form of a general prohibition\nagainst the State as well as others:\nArticles 17\n, 23\nand\n24.\nThe enunciation of rights either express or\nby implication does not follow a uniform pattern. But\none thread runs through them: they seek to protect\nthe rights of the individual or groups of individuals\nagainst infringement of those rights within specific\nlimits. Part III of the Constitution weaves a pattern of\nguarantees on the texture of basic human rights.\nThe guarantees delimit the protection of those rights\nin their allotted fields: they do not attempt to\nenunciate distinct rights.\n53. We are therefore unable to hold that the\nchallenge to the validity of the provision for\n24\nacquisition is liable to be tested only on the ground\nof non-compliance with\nArticle 31(2).\nArticle 31(2)\nrequires that property must be acquired for a public\npurpose and that it must be acquired under a law\nwith characteristics set out in that Article. Formal\ncompliance with the conditions under\nArticle 31(2)\nis\nnot sufficient to negative the protection of the\nguarantee of the right to property. Acquisition must\nbe under the authority of a law and the expression\n“law” means a law which is within the competence\nof the Legislature, and does not impair the\nguarantee of the rights in Part III. We are unable,\ntherefore, to agree that\nArticles 19(1)(f)\nand\n31(2)\nare mutually exclusive.”4\n(at page 289)\n22.\nInsofar as the other part of Fazl Ali, J.’s judgment is\nconcerned, that “due process” was an elastic enough\nexpression to comprehend substantive due process, a recent\njudgment in\nMohd. Arif v. Registrar\n, Supreme Court of India\n& Ors., (2014) 9 SCC 737, by a Constitution Bench of this\nCourt, has held:-\n“27. The stage was now set for the judgment in\nManeka Gandhi (1978) 1 SCC 248.          Several\njudgments were delivered, and the upshot of all of\n4\nShri Gopal Sankaranarayanan has argued that the statement contained in R.C. Cooper (supra) that 5 out of 6\nlearned Judges had held in\nGopalan\n(supra) that\nArticle 22\nwas a complete code and was to be read as such, is\nincorrect.\nHe referred to various extracts from the judgments in\nGopalan\n(supra) to demonstrate that this was, in\nfact, incorrect as\nArticle 21\nwas read together with\nArticle 22.\nWhile Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan may be correct,\nit is important to note that at least insofar as\nArticle 19\nwas concerned, none of the judgments except that of Fazl\nAli, J. were prepared to read\nArticles 19\nand\n21\ntogether.\nTherefore, on balance, it is important to note that R.C.\nCooper (supra) cleared the air to state that none of the fundamental rights can be construed as being mutually\nexclusive.\n25\nthem was that\nArticle 21\nwas to be read along with\nother fundamental rights, and so read not only has\nthe procedure established by law to be just, fair and\nreasonable, but also the law itself has to be\nreasonable as\nArticles 14\nand\n19\nhave now to be\nread into\nArticle 21.\n[See: at SCR pp. 646-648 per\nBeg, CJ., at SCR pp. 669, 671-674 and 687 per\nBhagwati, J. and at SCR pp. 720-723 per Krishna\nIyer, J.]. Krishna Iyer, J. set out the new doctrine\nwith remarkable clarity thus (SCR p.723, para 85):\n“85. To sum up, ‘procedure’ in\nArticle 21\nmeans        fair,    not   formal\nprocedure. ‘Law’ is reasonable law, not\nany         enacted           piece.       As\nArticle 22\nspecifically spells out the\nprocedural safeguards for preventive\nand punitive detention, a law providing\nfor such detentions should conform to\nArticle 22.\nIt has been rightly pointed out\nthat for other rights forming part of\npersonal       liberty,    the     procedural\nsafeguards enshrined in\nArticle 21\nare\navailable. Otherwise, as the procedural\nsafeguards contained in\nArticle 22\nwill\nbe available only in cases of preventive\nand punitive detention, the right to life,\nmore fundamental than any other\nforming part of personal liberty and\nparamount to the happiness, dignity and\nworth of the individual, will not be\nentitled to any procedural safeguard\nsave such as a legislature’s mood\nchooses.”\n28. Close on the heels of Maneka Gandhi case\ncame Mithu vs. State of Punjab, (1983) 2 SCC 277,\nin which case the Court noted as follows: (SCC pp.\n283-84, para 6)\n26\n“6…In      Sunil     Batra   v.     Delhi\nAdministration\n, (1978) 4 SCC 494, while\ndealing with the question as to whether\na person awaiting death sentence can\nbe kept in solitary confinement, Krishna\nIyer J. said that though our Constitution\ndid not have a “due process” clause as\nin the American Constitution; the same\nconsequence ensued after the decisions\nin the\nBank Nationalisation\ncase (\n1970)\n1 SCC 248, and Maneka Gandhi\ncase\n(1978) 1 SCC 248.…\nIn Bachan Singh (\nBachan Singh v. State\nof Punjab\n, (1980) 2 SCC 684) which\nupheld the constitutional validity of the\ndeath penalty, Sarkaria J., speaking for\nthe majority, said that if\nArticle 21\nis\nunderstood in accordance with the\ninterpretation put upon it in Maneka\nGandhi, it will read to say that: (SCC\np.730, para 136)\n“136. No person shall be deprived\nof his life or personal liberty except\naccording to fair, just and\nreasonable procedure established\nby valid law.”\nThe wheel has turned full circle.\nSubstantive due\nprocess is now to be applied to the fundamental\nright to life and liberty.”5\n5\nShri Rakesh Dwivedi has argued before us that in Maneka Gandhi (supra), Chandrachud, J. had, in paragraph 55\nof the judgment, clearly stated that substantive due process is no part of the Constitution of India.\nHe further\nargued that Krishna Iyer, J.’s statement in\nSunil Batra\n(supra) that a due process clause as contained in the U.S.\nConstitution is now to be read into\nArticle 21\n, is a standalone statement of the law and that “substantive due\nprocess” is an expression which brings in its wake concepts which do not fit into the Constitution of India.\nIt is not\npossible to accept this contention for the reason that in the Constitution Bench decision in Mithu (supra),\nChandrachud, C.J., did not refer to his concurring judgment in Maneka Gandhi (supra), but instead referred, with\napproval, to Krishna Iyer, J.’s statement of the law in paragraph 6.\nIt is this statement that is reproduced in\nparagraph 28 of\nMohd. Arif\n(supra). Also, “substantive due process” in our context only means that a law can be\n27\n(at pages 755-756)\n23.      The second great dissent, which is of Subba Rao, J., in\nKharak Singh (supra), has a direct bearing on the question to\nbe decided by us.6 In this judgment, Regulation 237 of the U.P.\nPolice Regulations was challenged as violating fundamental\nstruck down under\nArticle 21\nif it is not fair, just or reasonable on substantive and not merely procedural grounds.\nIn any event, it is Chandrachud,C.J’s earlier view that is a standalone view.\nIn\nCollector of Customs, Madras v.\nNathella Sampathu Chetty\n, (1962) 3 SCR 786 at 816, a Constitution Bench of this Court, when asked to apply\ncertain American decisions, stated the following:\n“It would be seen that the decisions proceed on the application of the “due process” clause of\nthe American Constitution. Though the tests of ‘reasonableness’\nlaid down by\nclauses (2) to (6) of\nArticle 19\nmight in great part coincide with that for judging of ‘due process’, it must not be\nassumed that these are identical, for it has to be borne in mind that the Constitution framers\ndeliberately avoided in this context the use of the expression ‘due process’ with its\ncomprehensiveness, flexibility and attendant vagueness, in favour of a somewhat more definite\nword “reasonable”, and caution has, therefore, to be exercised before the literal application of\nAmerican decisions.”\nMathew, J. in\nKesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala\n, (1973) Supp. SCR 1 at 824, 825 and 826 commented on this\nparticular passage thus:\n“When a court adjudges that a legislation is bad on the ground that it is an unreasonable\nrestriction, it is drawing the elusive ingredients for its conclusion from several sources. In fact,\nyou measure the reasonableness of a restriction imposed by law by indulging in an authentic bit\nof special legislation [See Learned Hand, Bill of Rights, p. 26]. “The words ‘reason’ and\n‘reasonable’ denote for the common law lawyer ideas which the ‘Civilians’ and the ‘Canonists’\nput under the head of the ‘law of nature’…”\n“…The limitations in\nArticle 19\nof the Constitution open the doors to judicial review of legislation\nin India in much the same manner as the doctrine of police power and its companion, the due\nprocess clause, have done in the United States. The restrictions that might be imposed by the\nLegislature to ensure the public interest must be reasonable and, therefore, the Court will have\nto apply the yardstick of reason in adjudging the reasonableness. If you examine the cases\nrelating to the imposition of reasonable restrictions by a law, it will be found that all of them\nadopt a standard which the American Supreme Court has adopted in adjudging reasonableness\nof a legislation under the due process clause..”\n“…In the light of what I have said, I am unable to understand how the word ‘reasonable’ is more\ndefinite than the words ‘due process’…\"\n6\nChief Justice S.R. Das in his farewell speech had this to say about Subba Rao, J., “Then we have brother Subba\nRao, who is extremely unhappy because all our fundamental rights are going to the dogs on account of some ill-\nconceived judgments of his colleagues which require reconsideration.”\n28\nrights under\nArticle 19(1)(d)\nand\nArticle 21.\nThe Regulation\nreads as follows:-\n“Without prejudice to the right of Superintendents of\nPolice to put into practice any legal measures, such\nas shadowing in cities, by which they find they can\nkeep in touch with suspects in particular localities or\nspecial circumstances, surveillance may for most\npractical purposes be defined as consisting of one\nor more of the following measures:-\n(a) Secret picketing of the house or approaches to\nthe house of suspects;\n(b) domiciliary visits at night;\n(c) through periodical inquiries by officers not below\nthe rank of Sub-Inspector into repute, habits,\nassociations, income, expenses and occupation;\n(d) the reporting by constables and chaukidars of\nmovements and absences from home;\n(e) the verification of movements and absences by\nmeans of inquiry slips;\n(f) the collection and record on a history-sheet of all\ninformation bearing on conduct.”\n24.   All 6 Judges struck down sub-para (b), but Subba Rao, J.\njoined by Shah, J., struck down the entire Regulation as\nviolating the individual’s right to privacy in the following words:\n“Further, the right to personal liberty takes in not\nonly a right to be free from restrictions placed on his\nmovements, but also free from encroachments on\nhis private life. It is true our Constitution does not\nexpressly declare a right to privacy as a\nfundamental right, but the said right is an essential\ningredient of personal liberty. Every democratic\n29\ncountry sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to\ngive him rest, physical happiness, peace of mind\nand security. In the last resort, a person’s house,\nwhere he lives with his family, is his “castle”: it is his\nrampart against encroachment on his personal\nliberty. The pregnant words of that famous Judge,\nFrankfurter J., in Wolf v. Colorado (1949) 338 U.\nS.\n25\n, pointing out the importance of the security of\none’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the\npolice, could have no less application to an Indian\nhome as to an American one. If physical restraints\non a person’s movements affect his personal liberty,\nphysical encroachments on his private life would\naffect it in a larger degree. Indeed, nothing is more\ndeleterious to a man’s physical happiness and\nhealth than a calculated interference with his\nprivacy. We would, therefore, define the right of\npersonal liberty in\nArticle 21\nas a right of an\nindividual to be free from restrictions or\nencroachments on his person, whether those\nrestrictions or encroachments are directly imposed\nor indirectly brought about by calculated measures.\nIf so understood, all the acts of surveillance under\nRegulation 236 infringe the fundamental right of the\npetitioner under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution.”\n(at page 359)\nThe 8 Judge Bench Decision in M.P. Sharma and the 6\nJudge Bench Decision in Kharak Singh\n25.   This takes us to the correctness of the aforesaid view,\nfirstly in light of the decision of the 8-Judge Bench in M.P.\nSharma (supra). The facts of that case disclose that certain\nsearches were made as a result of which a voluminous mass of\nrecords was seized from various places. The petitioners prayed\n30\nthat the search warrants which allowed such searches and\nseizures to take place be quashed, based on an argument\nfounded on\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution which says that no\nperson accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a\nwitness against himself. The argument which was turned down\nby the Court was that since this kind of search would lead to the\ndiscovery of several incriminating documents, a person\naccused of an offence would be compelled to be a witness\nagainst himself as such documents would incriminate him. This\nargument was turned down with reference to the law of\ntestimonial compulsion in the U.S., the U.K. and in this country.\nWhile dealing with the argument, this Court noticed that there is\nnothing in our Constitution corresponding to the Fourth\nAmendment     of   the   U.S.   Constitution,   which   interdicts\nunreasonable searches and seizures. In so holding, this Court\nthen observed:\n“It is, therefore, clear that there is no basis in the\nIndian law for the assumption that a search or\nseizure of a thing or document is in itself to be\ntreated as compelled production of the same.\nIndeed a little consideration will show that the two\nare essentially different matters for the purpose\nrelevant to the present discussion. A notice to\nproduce is addressed to the party concerned and\n31\nhis production in compliance therewith constitutes a\ntestimonial act by him within the meaning of\narticle\n20(3)\nas above explained. But search warrant is\naddressed to an officer of the Government,\ngenerally a police officer. Neither the search nor the\nseizure are acts of the occupier of the searched\npremises. They are acts of another to which he is\nobliged to submit and are, therefore, not his\ntestimonial acts in any sense.”\n“A power of search and seizure is in any system of\njurisprudence an overriding power of the State for\nthe protection of social security and that power is\nnecessarily regulated by law. When the Constitution\nmakers have thought fit not to subject such\nregulation to constitutional limitations by recognition\nof a fundamental right to privacy, analogous to the\nAmerican Fourth Amendment, we have no\njustification to import it, into a totally different\nfundamental right, by some process of strained\nconstruction.”\n(at pages 1096-1097)\n26.   The first thing that strikes one on reading the aforesaid\npassage is that the Court resisted the invitation to read the U.S.\nFourth Amendment into the U.S. Fifth Amendment; in short it\nrefused to read or import the Fourth Amendment into the Indian\nequivalent of that part of the Fifth Amendment which is the\nsame as\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution of India. Also, the\nfundamental right to privacy, stated to be analogous to the\nFourth Amendment, was held to be something which could not\nbe read into\nArticle 20(3).\n32\n27.   The second interesting thing to be noted about these\nobservations is that there is no broad ratio in the said judgment\nthat a fundamental right to privacy is not available in Part III of\nthe Constitution. The observation is confined to\nArticle 20(3).\nFurther, it is clear that the actual finding in the aforesaid case\nhad to do with the law which had developed in this Court as\nwell as the U.S. and the U.K. on\nArticle 20(3)\nwhich, on the\nfacts of the case, was held not to be violated.\nAlso we must not\nforget that this was an early judgment of the Court, delivered in\nthe\nGopalan\n(supra) era, which did not have the benefit of R.C.\nCooper (supra) or Maneka Gandhi (supra). Quite apart from\nthis, it is clear that by the time this judgment was delivered,\nIndia was already a signatory to the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights,\nArticle 12\nof which states:\n“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference\nwith his privacy, family, home or correspondence,\nnor to attacks upon his honour and reputation.\nEveryone has the right to the protection of the law\nagainst such interference or attacks.”\n33\n28.   It has always been the law of this Court that international\ntreaties must be respected. Our Constitution contains Directive\nPrinciple 51(c), which reads as under:\n“51. The State shall endeavour to—\n(a) & (b)   xxx   xxx   xxx\n(c) foster respect for international law and treaty\nobligations in the dealings of organized peoples with\none another;”\nIn order that legislation be effected to implement an\ninternational treaty,\nArticle 253\nremoves legislative competence\nfrom all the States and entrusts only the Parliament with such\nlegislation.\nArticle 253\nreads as follows:\n“253. Legislation for giving effect to international\nagreements. - Notwithstanding anything in the\nforegoing provisions of this Chapter, Parliament has\npower to make any law for the whole or any part of\nthe territory of India for implementing any treaty,\nagreement or convention with any other country or\ncountries or any decision made at any international\nconference, association or other body.”\nWe were shown judgments of the highest Courts in the\nU.K. and the U.S in this behalf. At one extreme stands the\nUnited Kingdom, which states that international treaties are not\na part of the laws administered in England. At the other end of\nthe spectrum, Article VI of the U.S. Constitution declares:\n34\n“xxx xxx    xxx\nThis Constitution, and the laws of the United States\nwhich shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all\ntreaties made, or which shall be made, under the\nauthority of the United States, shall be the supreme\nlaw of the land; and the judges in every state shall\nbe bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or\nlaws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\nxxx   xxx   xxx”\nIt is thus clear that no succor can be drawn from the\nexperience of either the U.K. or the U.S.   We must proceed in\naccordance with the law laid down in the judgments of the\nSupreme Court of India.\n29.   Observations of several judgments make it clear that in\nthe absence of any specific prohibition in municipal law,\ninternational law forms part of Indian law and consequently\nmust be read into or as part of our fundamental rights. (For this\nproposition, see: Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2\nSCC 684 at paragraph 139, Francis Coralie Mullin v.\nAdministrator, Union Territory of Delhi & Ors., (1981) 1 SCC\n608 at paragraph 8,\nVishaka & Ors. v. State of Rajasthan &\nOrs.\n, (1997) 6 SCC 241 at paragraph 7 and\nNational Legal\nServices Authority v. Union of India\n, (2014) 5 SCC 438 at\n35\nparagraphs 51-60). This last judgment is instructive in that it\nrefers to international treaties and covenants, the Constitution,\nand various earlier judgments. The conclusion in paragraph 60\nis as follows:\n“The principles discussed hereinbefore on TGs and\nthe international conventions, including Yogyakarta\nPrinciples, which we have found not inconsistent\nwith the various fundamental rights guaranteed\nunder the Indian Constitution, must be recognized\nand followed, which has sufficient legal and\nhistorical justification in our country.”\n(at page 487)\n30.   In fact, the\nProtection of Human Rights Act, 1993\n, makes\ninteresting reading in this context.\nSection 2(1)(d)\nand (f) are important, and read as follows:\n“2. Definitions. – (1) In this Act, unless the context\notherwise requires, -\n(a) xxx xxx xxx\n(b) xxx xxx xxx\n(c) xxx xxx xxx\n(d) “human rights” means the rights relating to\nlife, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual\nguaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the\nInternational Covenants and enforceable by courts\nin India;\n(e) xxx xxx xxx\n(f)     “International   Covenants”    means      the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\nand the International Covenant on Economic, Social\nand Cultural Rights adopted by the General\nAssembly of the United Nations on the 16th\nDecember, 1966 and such other Covenant or\n36\nConvention adopted by the General Assembly of\nthe United Nations as the Central Government may,\nby notification, specify;”\n31.   In terms of\nSection 12(f)\n, one important function of the\nNational Human Rights Commission is to study treaties and\nother international instruments on human rights and make\nrecommendations for their effective implementation. In a recent\njudgment delivered by Lokur, J. in Extra Judl. Exec.\nVictim\nFamilies Association & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.\nin\nW.P.(Crl.) No.129 of 2012 decided on July 14, 2017, this Court\nhighlighted the\nProtection of Human Rights Act, 1993\nas\nfollows:-\n“29. Keeping this in mind, as well as the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, Parliament enacted\nthe\nProtection of Human Rights Act, 1993\n. The\nStatement of Objects and Reasons for the\nProtection of Human Rights Act, 1993\nis of\nconsiderable significance and accepts the\nimportance of issues relating to human rights with a\nview, inter alia, to bring accountability and\ntransparency in human rights jurisprudence. The\nStatement of Objects and Reasons reads as under:-\n“1. India is a party to the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights\nand the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural rights,\nadopted by the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations on the 16th December,\n1966. The human rights embodied in the\n37\naforesaid covenants stand substantially\nprotected by the Constitution.\n2. However, there has been growing\nconcern in the country and abroad about\nissues relating to human rights. Having\nregard to this, changing social realities\nand the emerging trends in the nature of\ncrime and violence, Government has\nbeen reviewing the existing laws,\nprocedures       and       systems     of\nadministration of justice; with a view to\nbringing about greater accountability\nand transparency in them, and devising\nefficient and effective methods of\ndealing with the situation.\n3. Wide ranging discussions were held\nat various fora such as the Chief\nMinisters’ Conference on Human Rights,\nseminars organized in various parts of\nthe country and meetings with leaders of\nvarious political parties. Taking into\naccount the views expressed in these\ndiscussions, the present Bill is brought\nbefore Parliament.”\n30. Under the provisions of the\nProtection of Human\nRights Act, 1993\nthe NHRC has been constituted as\na high-powered statutory body whose Chairperson\nis and always has been a retired Chief Justice of\nIndia. Amongst others, a retired judge of the\nSupreme Court and a retired Chief Justice of a High\nCourt is and has always been a member of the\nNHRC.\n31.\nIn\nRam Deo Chauhan v. Bani Kanta Das\n((2010)\n14 SCC 209), this Court recognized that the words\n‘human rights’ though not defined in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights have been defined in\nthe\nProtection of Human Rights Act, 1993\nin very\n38\nbroad terms and that these human rights are\nenforceable by courts in India. This is what this\nCourt had to say in this regard in paragraphs 47-49\nof the Report:\n“Human rights are the basic, inherent,\nimmutable and inalienable rights to\nwhich a person is entitled simply by\nvirtue of his being born a human. They\nare such rights which are to be made\navailable as a matter of right. The\nConstitution and legislations of a\ncivilised country recognise them since\nthey are so quintessentially part of every\nhuman being. That is why every\ndemocratic country committed to the\nrule of law put into force mechanisms for\ntheir enforcement and protection.\nHuman rights are universal in nature.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human\nRights (hereinafter referred to as UDHR)\nadopted by the General Assembly of the\nUnited     Nations     on      10-12-1948\nrecognises and requires the observance\nof certain universal rights, articulated\ntherein, to be human rights, and these\nare acknowledged and accepted as\nequal and inalienable and necessary for\nthe inherent dignity and development of\nan individual. Consequently, though the\nterm “human rights” itself has not been\ndefined in UDHR, the nature and\ncontent of human rights can be\nunderstood from the rights enunciated\ntherein.\nPossibly considering the wide sweep of\nsuch basic rights, the definition of\n“human rights” in the 1993 Act has been\n39\ndesignedly kept           very broad        to\nencompass within it all the rights relating\nto life, liberty, equality and dignity of the\nindividual        guaranteed      by      the\nConstitution or embodied in the\nInternational         Covenants          and\nenforceable by courts in India. Thus, if a\nperson has been guaranteed certain\nrights either under the Constitution or\nunder an International Covenant or\nunder a law, and he is denied access to\nsuch a right, then it amounts to a clear\nviolation of his human rights and NHRC\nhas the jurisdiction to intervene for\nprotecting it.”\n32.   It may also be noted that the “International Principles on\nthe   Application   of   Human      Rights     to   Communication\nSurveillance” (hereinafter referred to as the “Necessary and\nProportionate Principles”), which were launched at the U.N.\nHuman Rights Council in Geneva in September 2013, were the\nproduct of a year-long consultation process among civil society,\nprivacy and technology experts. The Preamble to the\nNecessary and Proportionate Principles states as follows:\n“Privacy is a fundamental human right, and is\ncentral to the maintenance of democratic societies.\nIt is essential to human dignity and it reinforces\nother rights, such as freedom of expression and\ninformation, and freedom of association, and is\nrecognized under international human rights\nlaw…..”\n40\n33.   Ignoring\nArticle 12\nof the 1948 Declaration would by itself\nsound the death knell to the observations on the fundamental\nright of privacy contained in M.P. Sharma (supra).\n34.   It is interesting to note that, in at least three later\njudgments, this judgment was referred to only in passing in:\n(\n1) Sharda v. Dharmpal\n, (2003) 4 SCC 493 at 513-514:\n“54. The right to privacy has been developed by the\nSupreme Court over a period of time. A bench of\neight judges in\nM.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra\n(AIR\n1954 SC 300), AIR at pp. 306-07, para 18, in the\ncontext of search and seizure observed that:\n“When the Constitution-makers have\nthought fit not to subject such regulation\nto      constitutional   limitations    by\nrecognition of a fundamental right to\nprivacy, analogous to the American\nFourth Amendment, we have no\njustification to import it, into a totally\ndifferent fundamental right, by some\nprocess of strained construction.”\n55. Similarly in\nKharak Singh v. State of U.P.\n(AIR\n1963 SC 1295), the majority judgment observed\nthus: (AIR p. 1303, para 20)\n“The right of privacy is not a guaranteed\nright under our Constitution and\ntherefore the attempt to ascertain the\nmovements of an individual which is\nmerely a manner in which privacy is\ninvaded is not an infringement of a\n41\nfundamental right guaranteed by Part\nIII.”\n56. With the expansive interpretation of the phrase\n“personal liberty”, this right has been read into\nArticle 21\nof the Indian Constitution. (See\nR.\nRajagopal v. State of T.N.\n, (1994) 6 SCC 632 and\nPeople’s Union for\nCivil Liberties v. Union of India\n,\n(1997) 1 SCC 301).\nIn some cases the right has\nbeen held to amalgam of various rights.”\n(2) District Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad & Anr. v.\nCanara Bank etc., (2005) 1 SCC 496 at 516, where this Court\nheld:\n“35. The earliest case in India to deal with “privacy”\nand “search and seizure” was M.P. Sharma v.\nSatish Chandra (1954 SCR 1077) in the context of\nArticle 19(1)(f)\nand\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution\nof India. The contention that search and seizure\nviolated\nArticle 19(1)(f)\nwas rejected, the Court\nholding that a mere search by itself did not affect\nany right to property, and though seizure affected it,\nsuch effect was only temporary and was a\nreasonable restriction on the right. The question\nwhether search warrants for the seizure of\ndocuments from the accused were unconstitutional\nwas not gone into. The Court, after referring to the\nAmerican authorities, observed that in the US,\nbecause of the language in the Fourth Amendment,\nthere was a distinction between legal and illegal\nsearches and seizures and that such a distinction\nneed not be imported into our Constitution. The\nCourt opined that a search warrant was addressed\nto an officer and not to the accused and did not\nviolate\nArticle 20(3).\nIn the present discussion the\ncase is of limited help.\nIn fact, the law as to privacy\n42\nwas developed in later cases by spelling it out from\nthe right to freedom of speech and expression in\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nand the right to “life” in Article 21.”\nAnd (3) Selvi v. State of Karnataka\n, (2010) 7 SCC 263 at 363,\nthis Court held as follows:-\n“205.\nIn M.P. Sharma (\nM.P. Sharma v. Satish\nChandra\n, AIR 1954 SC 300: 1954 SCC 1077), it\nhad been noted that the Indian Constitution did not\nexplicitly include a “right to privacy” in a manner\nakin to the Fourth Amendment of the US\nConstitution. In that case, this distinction was one\nof the reasons for upholding the validity of search\nwarrants issued for documents required to\ninvestigate charges of misappropriation and\nembezzlement.”\n35.   It will be seen that different smaller Benches of this court\nwere not unduly perturbed by the observations contained in\nM.P. Sharma (supra) as it was an early judgment of this Court\ndelivered in the\nGopalan\n(supra) era which had been eroded by\nlater judgments dealing with the inter-relation between\nfundamental rights and the development of the fundamental\nright of privacy as being part of the liberty and dignity of the\nindividual.\n36.   Therefore, given the fact that this judgment dealt only with\nArticle 20(3)\nand not with other fundamental rights; given the\n43\nfact that the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights\ncontaining the right to privacy was not pointed out to the Court;\ngiven the fact that it was delivered in an era when fundamental\nrights had to be read disjunctively in watertight compartments;\nand given the fact that\nArticle 21\nas we know it today only\nsprung into life in the post Maneka Gandhi (supra) era, we are\nof the view that this judgment is completely out of harm’s way\ninsofar as the grounding of the right to privacy in the\nfundamental rights chapter is concerned.\n37.   We now come to the majority judgment of 4 learned\nJudges in Kharak Singh (supra). When examining sub-clause\n(b) of Regulation 236, which endorsed domiciliary visits at night,\neven the majority had no hesitation in striking down the\naforesaid provision. This Court said that “life” used in\nArticle 21\nmust mean something more than mere animal existence and\n“liberty” something more than mere freedom from physical\nrestraint. This was after quoting the judgment of Field, J. in\nMunn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113 (1876).\nThe majority judgment,\nafter quoting from\nGopalan\n(supra), then went on to hold that\nArticle 19(1)\nand\nArticle 21\nare to be read separately, and so\n44\nread held that\nArticle 19(1)\ndeals with particular species or\nattributes of personal liberty, whereas\nArticle 21\ntakes in and\ncomprises the residue.7\n38.      This part of the judgment has been expressly overruled\nby R.C. Cooper (supra) as recognized by Bhagwati, J. in\nManeka Gandhi (supra):\n“5. It is obvious that\nArticle 21\n, though couched in\nnegative language, confers the fundamental right to\nlife and personal liberty. So far as the right to\npersonal liberty is concerned, it is ensured by\nproviding that no one shall be deprived of personal\nliberty except according to procedure prescribed by\nlaw. The first question that arises for consideration\non the language of\nArticle 21\nis: what is the\nmeaning and content of the words ‘personal liberty’\nas used in this article? This question incidentally\ncame up for discussion in some of the judgments\nin\nA.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras\n(AIR 1950 SC\n27: 1950 SCR 88: 51 Cri LJ 1383) and the\nobservations made by Patanjali Sastri, J.,\nMukherjea, J., and S.R. Das, J., seemed to place a\nnarrow interpretation on the words ‘personal liberty’\nso as to confine the protection of\nArticle 21\nto\nfreedom of the person against unlawful detention.\nBut there was no definite pronouncement made on\nthis point since the question before the Court was\nnot so much the interpretation of the words\n‘personal liberty’ as the inter-relation between\n7\nThis view of the law is obviously incorrect. If the Preamble to the Constitution of India is to be a guide as to the\nmeaning of the expression “liberty” in\nArticle 21\n, liberty of thought and expression would fall in\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nand\nArticle 21\nand belief, faith and worship in\nArticle 25\nand\nArticle 21.\nObviously, “liberty” in\nArticle 21\nis not confined\nto these expressions, but certainly subsumes them. It is thus clear that when\nArticle 21\nspeaks of “liberty”, it is,\natleast, to be read together with\nArticles 19(1)(a)\nand\n25.\n45\nArticles 19\nand\n21.\nIt was in\nKharak Singh v. State\nof U.P.\n(AIR 1963 SC 1295: (1964) 1 SCR 332:\n(1963) 2 Cri LJ 329) that the question as to the\nproper scope and meaning of the expression\n‘personal liberty’ came up pointedly for\nconsideration for the first time before this Court. The\nmajority of the Judges took the view “that ‘personal\nliberty’ is used in the article as a compendious term\nto include within itself all the varieties of rights which\ngo to make up the ‘personal liberties’ of man other\nthan those dealt with in the several clauses of\nArticle 19(1).\nIn other words, while\nArticle 19(1)\ndeals with particular species or attributes of that\nfreedom, ‘personal liberty’ in\nArticle 21\ntakes in and\ncomprises the residue”. The minority Judges,\nhowever, disagreed with this view taken by the\nmajority and explained their position in the following\nwords: “No doubt the expression ‘personal liberty’ is\na comprehensive one and the right to move freely is\nan attribute of personal liberty. It is said that the\nfreedom to move freely is carved out of personal\nliberty and, therefore, the expression ‘personal\nliberty’ in\nArticle 21\nexcludes that attribute. In our\nview, this is not a correct approach. Both are\nindependent fundamental rights, though there is\noverlapping. There is no question of one being\ncarved out of another. The fundamental right of life\nand personal liberty has many attributes and some\nof them are found in\nArticle 19.\nIf a person's\nfundamental right under\nArticle 21\nis infringed, the\nState can rely upon a law to sustain the action, but\nthat cannot be a complete answer unless the said\nlaw satisfies the test\nlaid down in\nArticle 19(2)\nso far\nas the attributes covered by\nArticle 19(1)\nare\nconcerned.” There can be no doubt that in view of\nthe decision of this Court in R.C. Cooper v. Union of\nIndia [(1970) 2 SCC 298: (1971) 1 SCR 512] the\nminority view must be regarded as correct and the\nmajority view must be held to have been overruled.”\n(at pages 278-279)\n46\n39.   The majority judgment in Kharak Singh (supra) then\nwent on to refer to the Preamble to the Constitution, and stated\nthat\nArticle 21\ncontained the cherished human value of dignity\nof the individual as the means of ensuring his full development\nand evolution. A passage was then quoted from Wolf v.\nColorado, 338 U.\nS. 25 (1949)\nto the effect that the security of\none’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police is basic to\na free society. The Court then went on to quote the U.S. Fourth\nAmendment which guarantees the rights of the people to be\nsecured in their persons, houses, papers and effects against\nunreasonable searches and seizures. Though the Indian\nConstitution did not expressly confer a like guarantee, the\nmajority held that nonetheless an unauthorized intrusion into a\nperson’s home would violate the English Common Law maxim\nwhich asserts that every man’s house is his castle. In this view\nof\nArticle 21\n, Regulation 236(b) was struck down.\n40.   However, while upholding sub-clauses (c), (d) and (e) of\nRegulation 236, the Court stated (at page 351):\n47\n“As already pointed out, the right of privacy is not a\nguaranteed right under our Constitution and\ntherefore the attempt to ascertain the movements of\nan individual which is merely a manner in which\nprivacy is invaded is not an infringement of a\nfundamental right guaranteed by Part III.”\nThis passage is a little curious in that clause (b) relating to\ndomiciliary visits was struck down only on the basis of the\nfundamental right to privacy understood in the sense of a\nrestraint against the person of a citizen. It seems that the earlier\npassage in the judgment which stated that despite the fact that\nthe U.S. Fourth Amendment was not reflected in the Indian\nConstitution, yet any unauthorized intrusion into a person’s\nhome, which is nothing but a facet of the right to privacy, was\ngiven a go by.\n41.   Peculiarly enough, without referring to the extracted\npassage in which the majority held that the right to privacy is\nnot a guaranteed right under our Constitution, the majority\njudgment has been held as recognizing a fundamental right to\nprivacy in\nArticle 21.\n(See:\nPUCL v. Union of India\n, (1997) 1\nSCC 301 at paragraph 14;\nMr. ‘X’ v. Hospital ‘Z’\n, (1998) 8\nSCC 296 at paragraphs 21 and 22;\nDistrict Registrar and\n48\nCollector, Hyderabad & Anr. v. Canara Bank\n, etc., (2005) 1\nSCC 496 at paragraph 36; and Thalappalam Service Co-\noperative\nBank Limited & Ors. v. State of Kerala & Ors.\n,\n(2013) 16 SCC 82 at paragraph 57).\n42.   If the passage in the judgment dealing with domiciliary\nvisits at night and striking it down is contrasted with the later\npassage upholding the other clauses of Regulation 236\nextracted above, it becomes clear that it cannot be said with\nany degree of clarity that the majority judgment upholds the\nright to privacy as being contained in the fundamental rights\nchapter or otherwise.      As the majority judgment contradicts\nitself on this vital aspect, it would be correct to say that it cannot\nbe given much value as a binding precedent. In any case, we\nare of the view that the majority judgment is good law when it\nspeaks of\nArticle 21\nbeing designed to assure the dignity of the\nindividual as a most cherished human value which ensures the\nmeans of full development and evolution of a human being.\nThe majority judgment is also correct in pointing out that\nArticle\n21\ninterdicts unauthorized intrusion into a person’s home.\nWhere the majority judgment goes wrong is in holding that\n49\nfundamental rights are in watertight compartments and in\nholding that the right of privacy is not a guaranteed right under\nour Constitution. It can be seen, therefore, that the majority\njudgment is like the proverbial curate’s egg – good only in parts.\nStrangely enough when the good parts alone are seen, there is\nno real difference between Subba Rao, J.’s approach in the\ndissenting judgment and the majority judgment.           This then\nanswers the major part of the reference to this 9-Judge Bench\nin that we hereby declare that neither the 8-Judge nor the 6-\nJudge Bench can be read to come in the way of reading the\nfundamental right to privacy into Part III of the Constitution.\n43.      However, the learned Attorney General has argued in\nsupport of the 8-Judge Bench and the 6-Judge Bench, stating\nthat the framers of the Constitution expressly rejected the right\nto privacy being made part of the fundament rights chapter of\nthe Constitution. While he may be right, Constituent Assembly\ndebates make interesting reading only to show us what exactly\nthe framers had in mind when they framed the Constitution of\nIndia.     As will be pointed out later in this judgment, our\njudgments expressly recognize that the Constitution governs\n50\nthe lives of 125 crore citizens of this country and must be\ninterpreted to respond to the changing needs of society at\ndifferent points in time.\n44.   The phrase “due process” was distinctly avoided by the\nframers of the Constitution and replaced by the colourless\nexpression “procedure established by law”. Despite this, owing\nto changed circumstances, Maneka Gandhi (supra) in 1978,\nfollowed by a number of judgments, have read what was\nexpressly rejected by the framers into\nArticle 21\n, so that by the\ntime of\nMohd. Arif\n(supra), this Court, at paragraph 28, was\nable to say that the wheel has turned full circle and substantive\ndue process is now part and parcel of\nArticle 21.\nGiven the\ntechnological revolution of the later part of the 20th century and\nthe completely altered lives that almost every citizen of this\ncountry leads, thanks to this revolution, the right to privacy has\nto be judged in today’s context and not yesterday’s.          This\nargument, therefore, need not detain us.\n45.   The learned Attorney General then argued that between\nthe right to life and the right to personal liberty, the former has\n51\nprimacy and any claim to privacy which would destroy or erode\nthis basic foundational right can never be elevated to the status\nof a fundamental right. Elaborating further, he stated that in a\ndeveloping country where millions of people are denied the\nbasic necessities of life and do not even have shelter, food,\nclothing or jobs, no claim to a right to privacy as a fundamental\nright would lie. First and foremost, we do not find any conflict\nbetween the right to life and the right to personal liberty. Both\nrights are natural and inalienable rights of every human being\nand are required in order to develop his/her personality to the\nfullest. Indeed, the right to life and the right to personal liberty\ngo hand-in-hand, with the right to personal liberty being an\nextension of the right to life. A large number of poor people that\nShri Venugopal talks about are persons who in today’s\ncompletely different and changed world have cell phones, and\nwould come forward to press the fundamental right of privacy,\nboth against the Government and against other private\nindividuals. We see no antipathy whatsoever between the rich\nand the poor in this context. It seems to us that this argument\nis made through the prism of the Aadhar (Targeted Delivery of\n52\nFinancial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act,\n2016, by which the Aadhar card is the means to see that\nvarious beneficial schemes of the Government filter down to\npersons for whom such schemes are intended. This 9-Judge\nBench has not been constituted to look into the constitutional\nvalidity of the Aadhar Act, but it has been constituted to\nconsider a much larger question, namely, that the right of\nprivacy would be found, inter alia, in\nArticle 21\nin both “life” and\n“personal liberty” by rich and poor alike primarily against State\naction.     This argument again does not impress us and is\nrejected.\n46.   Both the learned Attorney General and Shri Sundaram\nnext argued that the right to privacy is so vague and amorphous\na concept that it cannot be held to be a fundamental right. This\nagain need not detain us. Mere absence of a definition which\nwould encompass the many contours of the right to privacy\nneed not deter us from recognizing privacy interests when we\nsee them. As this judgment will presently show, these interests\nare broadly classified into interests pertaining to the physical\nrealm and interests pertaining to the mind. As case law, both in\n53\nthe U.S. and India show, this concept has travelled far from the\nmere right to be let alone to recognition of a large number of\nprivacy interests, which apart from privacy of one’s home and\nprotection from unreasonable searches and seizures have been\nextended to protecting an individual’s interests in making vital\npersonal choices such as the right to abort a fetus; rights of\nsame sex couples- including the right to marry; rights as to\nprocreation, contraception, general family relationships, child\nrearing, education, data protection, etc.   This argument again\nneed not detain us any further and is rejected.\n47.   As to the argument that if information is already in the\npublic domain and has been parted with, there is no privacy\nright, we may only indicate that the question as to “voluntary”\nparting with information has been dealt with, in the judgment in\nMiller v. United States, 425 US 435 (1976).\nThis Court in\nCanara Bank\n(supra) referred to the criticism of this judgment\nas follows:\n“(A) Criticism of Miller\n(i) The majority in Miller, 425 US 435 (1976), laid\ndown that a customer who has conveyed his affairs\nto another had thereby lost his privacy rights. Prof.\n54\nTribe states in his treatise (see p. 1391) that this\ntheory reveals “alarming tendencies” because the\nCourt has gone back to the old theory that privacy is\nin relation to property while it has laid down that the\nright is one attached to the person rather than to\nproperty. If the right is to be held to be not attached\nto the person, then “we would not shield our\naccount balances, income figures and personal\ntelephone and address books from the public eye,\nbut might instead go about with the information\nwritten on our ‘foreheads or our bumper stickers’.”\nHe observes that the majority in Miller, 425 US 435\n(1976), confused “privacy” with “secrecy” and that\n“even their notion of secrecy is a strange one, for\na secret remains a secret even when shared with\nthose whom one selects for one's confidence”. Our\ncheques are not merely negotiable instruments but\nyet the world can learn a vast amount about us by\nknowing how and with whom we have spent our\nmoney. Same is the position when we use the\ntelephone or post a letter. To say that one assumes\ngreat risks by opening a bank account appeared to\nbe a wrong conclusion. Prof. Tribe asks a very\npertinent question (p. 1392):\n“Yet one can hardly be said to\nhave assumed a risk of surveillance in a\ncontext where, as a practical matter,\none had no choice. Only the most\ncommitted — and perhaps civilly\ncommittable — hermit can live without\na telephone, without a bank account,\nwithout mail. To say that one must take\na bitter pill with the sweet when one\nlicks a stamp is to exact a high\nconstitutional price indeed for living in\ncontemporary society.”\nHe concludes (p. 1400):\n55\n“In our information-dense technological\nera, when living inevitably entails\nleaving not just informational footprints\nbut parts of one's self in myriad\ndirectories,    files,   records     and\ncomputers, to hold that the Fourteenth\nAmendment did not reserve to\nindividuals some power to say when and\nhow and by whom that information and\nthose confidences were to be used,\nwould be to denigrate the central role\nthat informational autonomy must play in\nany developed concept of the self.”\n(ii) Prof. Yale Kamisar (again quoted by Prof.\nTribe) (p. 1392) says:\n“It is beginning to look as if the only way\nsomeone living in our society can avoid\n‘assuming the risk’ that various\nintermediate institutions will reveal\ninformation to the police is by engaging\nin drastic discipline, the kind of discipline\nof life under totalitarian regimes.”\n(at pages 520-521)\nIt may also be noticed that Miller (supra) was done away\nwith by a Congressional Act of 1978. This Court then went on to\nstate:\n“(B) Response to Miller by Congress\nWe shall next refer to the response by Congress\nto Miller, 425 US 435 (1976). (As stated earlier, we\nshould not be understood as necessarily\nrecommending this law as a model for India.) Soon\n56\nafter Miller, 425 US 435 (1976), Congress enacted\nthe Right to Financial Privacy Act, 1978 (Public Law\nNo. 95-630) 12 USC with Sections 3401 to 3422).\nThe statute accords customers of banks or similar\nfinancial institutions, certain rights to be notified of\nand a right to challenge the actions of Government\nin court at an anterior stage before disclosure is\nmade.\nSection 3401\nof the Act contains “definitions”.\nSection 3402 is important, and it says that “except\nas provided by Section 3403(c) or (d), 3413 or\n3414, no government authority may have access to\nor obtain copies of, or the information contained in\nthe financial records of any customer from a\nfinancial institution unless the financial records are\nreasonably described and that (1) such customer\nhas authorised such disclosure in accordance with\nSection 3404; (2) such records are disclosed in\nresponse to (a) administrative subpoenas or\nsummons to meet requirement of Section 3405; (b)\nthe requirements of a search warrant which meets\nthe requirements of Section 3406; (c) requirements\nof a judicial subpoena which meets the requirement\nof Section 3407; or (d) the requirements of a formal\nwritten requirement under Section 3408. If the\ncustomer decides to challenge the Government’s\naccess to the records, he may file a motion in the\nappropriate US District Court, to prevent such\naccess.\nThe Act\nalso provides for certain specific\nexceptions.”                             (at page 522)\n48.   Shri Sundaram has argued that rights have to be traced\ndirectly to those expressly stated in the fundamental rights\nchapter of the Constitution for such rights to receive protection,\nand privacy is not one of them. It will be noticed that the dignity\nof the individual is a cardinal value, which is expressed in the\n57\nPreamble to the Constitution.       Such dignity is not expressly\nstated as a right in the fundamental rights chapter, but has\nbeen read into the right to life and personal liberty. The right to\nlive with dignity is expressly read into\nArticle 21\nby the judgment\nin\nJolly George Varghese v. Bank of Cochin\n, (1980) 2 SCC\n360 at paragraph 10.\nSimilarly, the right against bar fetters and\nhandcuffing being integral to an individual’s dignity was read\ninto\nArticle 21\nby the judgment in Charles Sobraj v. Delhi\nAdministration, (1978) 4 SCC 494 at paragraphs 192,\n197-B,\n234   and    241    and    Prem     Shankar   Shukla    v.   Delhi\nAdministration\n, (1980) 3 SCC 526 at paragraphs 21 and 22. It\nis too late in the day to canvas that a fundamental right must be\ntraceable to express language in Part III of the Constitution. As\nwill be pointed out later in this judgment, a Constitution has to\nbe read in such a way that words deliver up principles that are\nto be followed and if this is kept in mind, it is clear that the\nconcept of privacy is contained not merely in personal liberty,\nbut also in the dignity of the individual.\n49.   The judgment in Stanley v. Georgia, 22 L.Ed. 2d 542 at\n549, 550 and 551 (1969) will serve to illustrate how privacy is\n58\nconceptually   different   from   an   expressly   enumerated\nfundamental right. In this case, the appellant before the Court\nwas tried and convicted under a Georgia statute for knowingly\nhaving possession of obscene material in his home. The U.S.\nSupreme Court referred to judgments which had held that\nobscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected\nspeech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nYet, the Court held:\n“It is now well established that the Constitution\nprotects the right to receive information and ideas.\n“This freedom [of speech and press] … necessarily\nprotects the right to receive……” Martin v. City of\nStruthers, 319 US 141, 143, 87 L Ed 1313, 1316, 63\nS Ct 862 (1943); see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381\nUS 479, 482, 14 L Ed 2d 510, 513, 85 S Ct 1678\n(1965); Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S.\n301, 307-308, 14 L Ed 2d 398, 402, 403, 85 S Ct\n1493 (1965) (Brennan, J., concurring); cf. Pierce v.\nSociety of the Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 69 L Ed 1070,\n45 S Ct 571, 39 ALR 468 (1925). This right to\nreceive information and ideas, regardless of their\nsocial worth, see Winters v. New York, 333 US 507,\n510, 92 L Ed 840, 847, 68 S Ct 665 (1948), is\nfundamental to our free society. Moreover, in the\ncontext of this case—a prosecution for mere\npossession of printed or filmed matter in the privacy\nof a person's own home—that right takes on an\nadded dimension. For also fundamental is the right\nto be free, except in very limited circumstances,\nfrom unwanted governmental intrusions into one's\nprivacy…\n59\nThese are the rights that appellant is asserting in\nthe case before us. He is asserting the right to read\nor observe what he pleases—the right to satisfy his\nintellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his\nown home. He is asserting the right to be free from\nstate inquiry into the contents of his library. Georgia\ncontends that appellant does not have these rights,\nthat there are certain types of materials that the\nindividual may not read or even possess. Georgia\njustifies this assertion by arguing that the films in the\npresent case are obscene. But we think that mere\ncategorization of these films as “obscene” is\ninsufficient justification for such a drastic invasion of\npersonal liberties guaranteed by the First and\nFourteenth Amendments. Whatever may be the\njustifications for other statutes regulating obscenity,\nwe do not think they reach into the privacy of one's\nown home. If the First Amendment means anything,\nit means that a State has no business telling a man,\nsitting alone in his own house, what books he may\nread or what films he may watch. Our whole\nconstitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving\ngovernment the power to control men's minds.”\n(Emphasis Supplied)\nThe Court concluded by stating:\n“We hold that the First and Fourteenth Amendments\nprohibit making mere private possession of obscene\nmaterial a crime. Roth and the cases following that\ndecision are not impaired by today's holding. As we\nhave said, the States retain broad power to regulate\nobscenity; that power simply does not extend to\nmere possession by the individual in the privacy of\nhis own home.”\n50.   This case, more than any other, brings out in bold relief,\nthe difference between the right to privacy and the right to\n60\nfreedom of speech.       Obscenity was held to be outside the\nfreedom of speech amended by the First Amendment, but a\nprivacy interest which related to the right to read obscene\nmaterial was protected under the very same Amendment.\nObviously, therefore, neither is privacy as vague and\namorphous as has been argued, nor is it correct to state that\nunless it finds express mention in a provision in Part III of the\nConstitution, it should not be regarded as a fundamental right.\n51.   Shri Sundaram’s argument that personal liberty is\ndifferent from civil liberty need not detain us at all for the reason\nthat at least qua the fundament right to privacy — that right\nbeing intimately connected with the liberty of the person would\ncertainly fall within the expression “personal liberty”.\n52.   According to Shri Sundaram, every facet of privacy is not\nprotected. Instances of actions which, according to him, are not\nprotected are:\n•     “Taxation laws requiring the furnishing of\ninformation;\n•     In relation to a census;\n61\n•     Details   and   documents     required    to   be\nfurnished for the purpose of obtaining a passport;\n•     Prohibitions     pertaining      to      viewing\npornography.”\n53.   We are afraid that this is really putting the cart before the\nhorse. Taxation laws which require the furnishing of information\ncertainly impinge upon the privacy of every individual which\nought to receive protection. Indeed, most taxation laws which\nrequire the furnishing of such information also have, as a\nconcomitant    provision,    provisions    which     prohibit   the\ndissemination of such information to others except under\nspecified circumstances which have relation to some legitimate\nor important State or societal interest. The same would be the\ncase in relation to a census and details and documents\nrequired to be furnished for obtaining a passport. Prohibitions\npertaining to viewing pornography have been dealt with earlier\nin this judgment.     The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in\nStanley (supra) held that such prohibitions would be invalid if\nthe State were to intrude into the privacy of one’s home.\n62\n54.   The learned Attorney General drew our attention to a\nnumber of judgments which have held that there is no\nfundamental right to trade in liquor and cited\nKhoday\nDistilleries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka\n, (1995) 1 SCC 574.\nQuite obviously, nobody has the fundamental right to carry on\nbusiness in crime.\nIndeed, in a situation where liquor is\nexpressly permitted to be sold under a licence, it would be\ndifficult to state that such seller of liquor would not have the\nfundamental right to trade under\nArticle 19(1)(g)\n, even though\nthe purport of some of our decisions seems to stating exactly\nthat – See the difference in approach between the earlier\nConstitution Bench judgment in\nKrishna Kumar Narula v.\nState of Jammu and Kashmir\n, (1967) 3 SCR 50, and the later\nConstitution Bench judgment in\nHar Shankar v. The Dy.\nExcise and Taxation Commr.\n, (1975) 1 SCC 737.            In any\nevent, the analogy to be drawn from the cases dealing with\nliquor does not take us further for the simple reason that the\nfundamental right to privacy once recognized, must yield in\ngiven circumstances to legitimate State interests in combating\ncrime.   But this arises only after recognition of the right to\n63\nprivacy as a fundamental right and not before. What must be a\nreasonable restriction in the interest of a legitimate State\ninterest or in public interest cannot determine whether the\nintrusion into a person’s affairs is or is not a fundamental right.\nEvery State intrusion into privacy interests which deals with the\nphysical body or the dissemination of information personal to an\nindividual or personal choices relating to the individual would be\nsubjected   to   the   balancing   test   prescribed    under   the\nfundamental right that it infringes depending upon where the\nprivacy interest claimed is founded.\n55.   The learned Attorney General and Shri Tushar Mehta,\nlearned Additional Solicitor General, in particular, argued that\nour statutes are replete with a recognition of the right to privacy,\nand Shri Tushar Mehta cited provisions of the\nRight to\nInformation Act, 2005\n, the\nIndian Easements Act, 1882\n, the\nIndian Penal Code\n, 1860, the\nIndian Telegraph Act, 1885\n, the\nBankers’\nBooks Evidence Act, 1891\n, the\nCredit Information\nCompanies (Regulation) Act, 2005\n, the Public Financial\nInstitutions (Obligation as to Fidelity and Secrecy) Act, 1983,\nthe\nPayment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007\n, the Income\n64\nTax Act, 1961\n, the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and\nother Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, the\nCensus\nAct, 1948\n, the\nCollection of Statistics Act, 2008\n, the\nJuvenile\nJustice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015\n, the\nProtection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012\nand the\nInformation Technology Act, 2000\n. According to them, since\nthese statutes already protect the privacy rights of individuals, it\nis unnecessary to read a fundamental right of privacy into Part\nIII of the Constitution.\n56.   Statutory law can be made and also unmade by a simple\nParliamentary majority. In short, the ruling party can, at will, do\naway with any or all of the protections contained in the statutes\nmentioned hereinabove.       Fundamental rights, on the other\nhand, are contained in the Constitution so that there would be\nrights that the citizens of this country may enjoy despite the\ngovernments that they may elect. This is all the more so when\na particular fundamental right like privacy of the individual is an\n“inalienable” right which inheres in the individual because he is\na human being. The recognition of such right in the\nfundamental rights chapter of the Constitution is only a\n65\nrecognition that such right exists notwithstanding the shifting\nsands    of   majority   governments.     Statutes    may    protect\nfundamental rights; they may also infringe them. In case any\nexisting statute or any statute to be made in the future is an\ninfringement of the inalienable right to privacy, this Court would\nthen be required to test such statute against such fundamental\nright and if it is found that there is an infringement of such right,\nwithout any countervailing societal or public interest, it would be\nthe duty of this Court to declare such legislation to be void as\noffending the fundamental right to privacy.          This argument,\ntherefore, also merits rejection.\n57.   Shri    Rakesh     Dwivedi    referred    copiously   to   the\n“reasonable expectation of privacy” test\nlaid down by\ndecisions\nof the U.S. Supreme Court. The origin of this test is to be found\nin the concurring judgment of Harlan, J. in Katz v. United\nStates, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). Though this test has been applied\nby several subsequent decisions, even in the United States, the\napplication of this test has been criticized.\n66\n58.   In Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 119 S.Ct. 469 at\n477 (1998), the concurring judgment of Scalia, J. criticized the\napplication of the aforesaid test in the following terms:\n“The dissent believes that “[o]ur obligation to\nproduce coherent results” requires that we ignore\nthis clear text and 4-century-old tradition, and apply\ninstead the notoriously unhelpful test adopted in a\n“benchmar[k]” decision that is 31 years old. Post, at\n110, citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88\nS.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). In my view, the\nonly thing the past three decades have established\nabout the Katz test (which has come to mean the\ntest enunciated by Justice Harlan’s separate\nconcurrence in Katz, see id., at 360, 88 S.Ct. 507) is\nthat, unsurprisingly, those “actual (subjective)\nexpectation[s] of privacy” “that society is prepared to\nrecognize as ‘reasonable,’ ” id., at 361, 88 S.Ct.\n507, bear an uncanny resemblance to those\nexpectations of privacy that this Court considers\nreasonable. When that self-indulgent test is\nemployed (as the dissent would employ it here) to\ndetermine whether a “search or seizure” within the\nmeaning of the Constitution has occurred (as\nopposed to whether that “search or seizure” is an\n“unreasonable” one), it has no plausible foundation\nin the text of the Fourth Amendment. That provision\ndid not guarantee some generalized “right of\nprivacy” and leave it to this Court to determine\nwhich particular manifestations of the value of\nprivacy “society is prepared to recognize as\n‘reasonable’.” Ibid.”\nIn Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.\nS. 27\n, 121 S. Ct. 2038\nat 2043 (2001), the U.S. Supreme Court found that the use of a\n67\nthermal imaging device, aimed at a private home from a public\nstreet, to detect relative amounts of heat within the private\nhome would be an invasion of the privacy of the individual. In\nso holding, the U.S. Supreme Court stated:\n“The Katz test—whether the individual has an\nexpectation of privacy that society is prepared to\nrecognize as reasonable—has often been criticized\nas circular, and hence subjective and unpredictable.\nSee 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §2.1(d), pp.\n393-394 (3d ed. 1996); Posner, The Uncertain\nProtection of Privacy by the Supreme Court, 1979\nS. Ct. Rev. 173, 188; Carter, supra, at 97, 119 S.\nCt.     469     (SCALIA,       J., concurring).   But\nsee Rakas, supra, at 143-144, n. 12, 99 S. Ct. 421.\nWhile it may be difficult to refine Katz when the\nsearch of areas such as telephone booths,\nautomobiles, or even the curtilage and uncovered\nportions of residences are at issue, in the case of\nthe search of the interior of homes—the prototypical\nand hence most commonly litigated area of\nprotected privacy—there is a ready criterion, with\nroots deep in the common law, of the minimal\nexpectation of privacy that exists, and that is\nacknowledged to be reasonable. To withdraw\nprotection of this minimum expectation would be to\npermit police technology to erode the privacy\nguaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. We think\nthat obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any\ninformation regarding the interior of the home that\ncould not otherwise have been obtained without\nphysical “intrusion into a constitutionally protected\narea,” Silverman, 365 U.S., at 512, 81 S. Ct. 679\nconstitutes a search—at least where (as here) the\ntechnology in question is not in general public use.\nThis assures preservation of that degree of privacy\n68\nagainst government that existed when the Fourth\nAmendment was adopted.”\n59.   It is clear, therefore, that in the country of its origin, this\ntest though followed in certain subsequent judgments, has been\nthe subject matter of criticism. There is no doubt that such a\ntest has no plausible foundation in the text of\nArticles 14\n, 19\n, 20\nor 21 of our Constitution. Also, as has rightly been held, the\ntest is circular in the sense that there is no invasion of privacy\nunless the individual whose privacy is invaded had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. Whether such individual will\nor will not have such an expectation ought to depend on what\nthe position in law is. Also, this test is intrinsically linked with\nthe test of voluntarily parting with information, inasmuch as if\ninformation is voluntarily parted with, the person concerned can\nreasonably be said to have no expectation of any privacy\ninterest. This is nothing other than reading of the “reasonable\nexpectation of privacy” with the test in Miller (supra), which is\nthat if information is voluntarily parted with, no right to privacy\nexists.\nAs has been held by us, in\nCanara Bank\n(supra), this\nCourt referred to Miller (supra) and the criticism that it has\n69\nreceived in the country of its origin, and refused to apply it in\nthe Indian context.\nAlso, as has been discussed above, soon\nafter    Miller   (supra),   the   Congress   enacted   the    Right\nto Financial Privacy Act, 1978, doing away with the substratum\nof this judgment.      Shri Dwivedi’s argument must, therefore,\nstand rejected.\n60.     Shri   Gopal    Sankaranarayanan,     relying   upon     the\nstatement of law in\nBehram Khurshid Pesikaka v. State of\nBombay\n, (\n1955) 1 SCR 613,          Basheshar Nath v. CIT\n, (1959)\nSupp.\n(\n1) SCR 528 and Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal\nCorporation\n, (1985) 3 SCC 545, has argued that it is well\nestablished that fundamental rights cannot be waived. Since\nthis is the law in this country, if this Court were to hold that the\nright to privacy is a fundamental right, then it would not be\npossible to waive any part of such right and consequently would\nlead to the following complications:\n• All the statutory provisions that deal with aspects of\nprivacy would be vulnerable.\n70\n• The State would be barred from contractually obtaining\nvirtually any information about a person, including\nidentification,    fingerprints,     residential      address,\nphotographs, employment details, etc., unless they were\nall found to be not a part of the right to privacy.\n• The consequence would be that the judiciary would be\ntesting what aspects of privacy could be excluded from\nArticle 21\nrather than what can be included in\nArticle 21.\nThis argument again need not detain us. Statutory\nprovisions that deal with aspects of privacy would continue to\nbe tested on the ground that they would violate the fundamental\nright to privacy, and would not be struck down, if it is found on a\nbalancing test that the social or public interest and the\nreasonableness of the restrictions would outweigh the particular\naspect of privacy claimed.      If this is so, then statutes which\nwould enable the State to contractually obtain information about\npersons would pass muster in given circumstances, provided\nthey safeguard the individual right to privacy as well. A simple\nexample would suffice. If a person was to paste on Facebook\n71\nvital information about himself/herself, such information, being\nin the public domain, could not possibly be claimed as a\nprivacy right after such disclosure. But, in pursuance of a\nstatutory requirement,    if   certain   details   need    to   be\ngiven for the concerned statutory purpose, then such details\nwould certainly affect the right to privacy, but would on a\nbalance, pass muster as the State action concerned has\nsufficient inbuilt safeguards to protect this right – viz. the fact\nthat such information cannot be disseminated to anyone else,\nsave on compelling grounds of public interest.\nThe Fundamental Right to Privacy\n61.   This conclusion brings us to where the right to privacy\nresides and what its contours are. But before getting into this\nknotty question, it is important to restate a few constitutional\nfundamentals.\n62.   Never must we forget the great John Marshall, C.J.’s\nadmonition that it is a Constitution that we are expounding.\n[(see: McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316 at 407 (1819)].\nIndeed a Constitution is meant to govern people’s lives, and as\n72\npeople’s lives keep evolving and changing with the times, so\ndoes the interpretation of the Constitution to keep pace with\nsuch changes. This was well expressed in at least two\njudgments of this Court.\nIn\nAshok Tanwar & Anr. v. State of\nH.P. & Ors.\n, (2005) 2 SCC 104, a Constitution Bench stated as\nfollows:\n“This apart, the interpretation of a provision of the\nConstitution having regard to various aspects\nserving the purpose and mandate of the\nConstitution by this Court stands on a separate\nfooting. A constitution unlike other statutes is meant\nto be a durable instrument to serve through longer\nnumber of years, i.e., ages without frequent\nrevision. It is intended to serve the needs of the day\nwhen it was enacted and also to meet needs of the\nchanging conditions of the future. This Court in\nR.C.\nPoudyal v. Union of India\n, 1994 Supp (1) SCC 324,\nin paragraph 124, observed thus:\n“124. In judicial review of the vires of the\nexercise of a constitutional power such\nas the one under\nArticle 2\n, the\nsignificance and importance of the\npolitical components of the decision\ndeemed fit by Parliament cannot be put\nout of consideration as long as the\nconditions     do      not    violate    the\nconstitutional fundamentals. In the\ninterpretation     of    a    constitutional\ndocument, ‘words are but the framework\nof concepts and concepts may change\nmore than words themselves’. The\nsignificance of the change of the\nconcepts themselves is vital and the\n73\nconstitutional issues are not solved by a\nmere appeal to the meaning of the\nwords without an acceptance of the line\nof their growth. It is aptly said that ‘the\nintention of a Constitution is rather to\noutline principles than to engrave\ndetails’.”\nIn the First B.N. Rau Memorial Lecture on “Judicial\nMethods” M. Hidayatullah, J. observed:\n“More      freedom      exists    in    the\ninterpretation of the Constitution than in\nthe interpretation of ordinary laws. This\nis due to the fact that the ordinary law is\nmore often before courts, that there are\nalways dicta of judges readily available\nwhile in the domain of constitutional law\nthere is again and again novelty of\nsituation and approach.”\nChief Justice Marshall while deciding the celebrated\nMcCulloch v. Maryland [4 Wheaton (17 US) 316 : 4\nL Ed 579 (1819)] (Wheaton at p. 407, L.Ed. at p.\n602) made the pregnant remark—“we must never\nforget that it is the constitution we are\nexpounding”— meaning thereby that it is a question\nof new meaning in new circumstances. Cardozo in\nhis lectures also said: “The great generalities of the\nConstitution have a content and a significance that\nvary from age to age.” Chief Justice Marshall in\nMcCulloch v. Maryland [4 Wheaton (17 US) 316 : 4\nL Ed 579 (1819)] (L.Ed at pp 603-604) declared that\nthe Constitution was “intended to endure for ages to\ncome, and consequently, to be adapted to the\nvarious crises of human affairs”. In this regard it is\nworthwhile to see the observations made in\nparagraphs 324 to 326 in Supreme Court\n74\nAdvocates-on-Record Assn, (1993) 4 SCC 441:\n(SCC pp. 645-46)\n“324. The case before us must be\nconsidered in the light of our entire\nexperience and not merely in that of\nwhat was said by the framers of the\nConstitution.    While    deciding   the\nquestions posed before us we must\nconsider what is the judiciary today and\nnot what it was fifty years back. The\nConstitution has not only to be read in\nthe light of contemporary circumstances\nand values, it has to be read in such a\nway that the circumstances and values\nof the present generation are given\nexpression in its provisions. An eminent\njurist observed that ‘constitutional\ninterpretation is as much a process of\ncreation as one of discovery.’\n325. It would be useful to quote\nhereunder a paragraph from the\njudgment of Supreme Court of Canada\nin Hunter v. Southam Inc. (1984) 2 SCR\n145: [SCR at p.156 (Can)]\n‘It is clear that the meaning of\n“unreasonable” cannot be determined\nby recourse to a dictionary, nor for that\nmatter, by reference to the rules of\nstatutory construction. The task of\nexpounding a Constitution is crucially\ndifferent from that of construing a\nstatute. A statute defines present rights\nand obligations. It is easily enacted and\nas easily repealed. A Constitution, by\ncontrast, is drafted with an eye to the\nfuture. Its function is to provide a\ncontinuing framework for the legitimate\n75\nexercise of governmental power and,\nwhen joined by a Bill or a Charter of\nRights, for the unremitting protection of\nindividual rights and liberties. Once\nenacted, its provisions cannot easily be\nrepealed or amended. It must, therefore,\nbe capable of growth and development\nover time to meet new social, political\nand historical realities often unimagined\nby its framers. The judiciary is the\nguardian of the Constitution and must, in\ninterpreting its provisions, bear these\nconsiderations in mind. Professor Paul\nFreund expressed this idea aptly when\nhe admonished the American Courts\n“not to read the provisions of the\nConstitution like a last will and\ntestament lest it become one”.’\n326. The constitutional provisions\ncannot be cut down by technical\nconstruction rather it has to be given\nliberal and meaningful interpretation.\nThe ordinary rules and presumptions,\nbrought in aid to interpret the statutes,\ncannot be made applicable while\ninterpreting the provisions of the\nConstitution.\nIn Minister of Home Affairs\nv. Fisher [(1979) 3 All ER 21 : 1980 AC\n319]      dealing     with     Bermudian\nConstitution, Lord Wilberforce reiterated\nthat a Constitution is a document ‘sui\ngeneris, calling for principles of\ninterpretation of its own, suitable to its\ncharacter’.”\nThis Court in\nAruna Roy v. Union of India\n, (2002) 7\nSCC 368, recalled the famous words of the Chief\nJustice Holmes that “spirit of law is not logic but it\nhas been experience” and observed that these\nwords apply with greater force to constitutional law.\n76\nIn the same judgment this Court expressed that\nConstitution is a permanent document framed by\nthe people and has been accepted by the people to\ngovern them for all times to come and that the\nwords and expressions used in the Constitution, in\nthat sense, have no fixed meaning and must receive\ninterpretation based on the experience of the people\nin the course of working of the Constitution. The\nsame thing cannot be said in relation to interpreting\nthe words and expressions in a statute.”\n(at pages 114-116)\n63.   To similar effect is the judgment of a 9-Judge Bench in\nI.R. Coelho (dead) by LRs v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors.\n,\n(2007) 2 SCC 1, which states:\n“42. The Constitution is a living document. The\nconstitutional provisions have to be construed\nhaving regard to the march of time and the\ndevelopment of law. It is, therefore, necessary that\nwhile construing the doctrine of basic structure due\nregard be had to various decisions which led to\nexpansion and development of the law.”\n(at page 79)\n64.   It is in this background that the fundamental rights chapter\nhas been interpreted. We may also refer to paragraph 19 in\nM.\nNagaraj & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212,\nfor the proposition that any true interpretation of fundamental\nrights must be expansive, like the universe in which we live.\n77\nThe content of fundamental rights keeps expanding to keep\npace with human activity.\n65.      It is as a result of constitutional interpretation that after\nManeka Gandhi (supra),\nArticle 21\nhas been the repository of a\nvast multitude of human rights8.\n66.      In India, therefore, the doctrine of originalism, which was\nreferred to and relied upon by Shri Sundaram has no place.\nAccording to this doctrine, the first inquiry to be made is\n8\n(1) The right to go abroad.\nManeka Gandhi v.

According to the learned\nAttorney General and Shri Sundaram, the right to privacy has\nbeen considered and expressly rejected by our founding\nfathers. At the second level, according to this doctrine, it is not\nopen to the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution in a\nmanner that will give effect to a right that has been rejected by\nthe founding fathers. This can only be done by amending the\nConstitution. It was, therefore, urged that it was not open for us\nto interpret the fundamental rights chapter in such a manner as\nto introduce a fundamental right to privacy, when the founding\nfathers had rejected the same. It is only the Parliament in its\nconstituent capacity that can introduce such a right.          This\ncontention must be rejected having regard to the authorities\ncited above. Further, in our Constitution, it is not left to all the\nthree organs of the State to interpret the Constitution. When a\nsubstantial question as to the interpretation of the Constitution\narises, it is this Court and this Court alone under\nArticle 145(3)\nthat is to decide what the interpretation of the Constitution shall\n79\nbe, and for this purpose the Constitution entrusts this task to a\nminimum of 5 Judges of this Court.\n67.      Does a fundamental right to privacy reside primarily in\nArticle 21\nread with certain other fundamental rights?\n68.      At this point, it is important to advert to the U.S. Supreme\nCourt’s development of the right of privacy.\nThe earlier cases tended to see the right of privacy as a\nproperty right as they were part of what was called the ‘Lochner\nera’ during which the doctrine of substantive due process\nelevated property rights over societal interests9. Thus in an\nearly case, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 at 474,\n478 and 479 (1928), the majority of the Court held that wiretaps\nattached to telephone wires on public streets did not constitute\na “search” under the Fourth Amendment since there was no\nphysical entry into any house or office of the defendants. In a\nclassic dissenting judgment, Louis Brandeis, J. held that this\n9                                th\nThis era lasted from the early 20 Century till 1937, when the proverbial switch in time that saved nine was made\nby Justice Roberts. It was only from 1937 onwards that President Roosevelt’s New Deal legislations were upheld\nby a majority of 5:4, having been struck down by a majority of 5:4 previously.\n80\nwas too narrow a construction of the Fourth Amendment and\nsaid in words that were futuristic that:\n“Moreover, “in the application of a constitution, our\ncontemplation cannot be only of what has been but\nof what may be.” The progress of science in\nfurnishing the Government with means of espionage\nis not likely to stop with wiretapping. Ways may\nsomeday be developed by which the Government,\nwithout removing papers from secret drawers, can\nreproduce them in court, and by which it will be\nenabled to expose to a jury the most intimate\noccurrences of the home. Advances in the psychic\nand related sciences may bring means of exploring\nunexpressed beliefs, thoughts and emotions. “That\nplaces the liberty of every man in the hands of every\npetty officer” was said by James Otis of much lesser\nintrusions than these. To Lord Camden, a far\nslighter intrusion seemed “subversive of all the\ncomforts of society.” Can it be that the Constitution\naffords no protection against such invasions of\nindividual security?”\n69.   Also in a ringing declaration of the right to privacy, that\ngreat Judge borrowed from his own co-authored article, written\nalmost 40 years earlier, in order to state that the right of privacy\nis a constitutionally protected right:\n“The protection guaranteed by the Amendments is\nmuch broader in scope. The makers of our\nConstitution undertook to secure conditions\nfavorable to the pursuit of happiness.         They\nrecognized the significance of man’s spiritual\nnature, of his feelings, and of his intellect. They\nknew that only a part of the pain, pleasure and\n81\nsatisfaction of life are to be found in material things.\nThey sought to protect Americans in their beliefs,\ntheir thoughts, their emotions and their sensations.\nThey conferred, as against the Government, the\nright to be let alone – the most comprehensive of\nrights, and the right most valued by civilized men.\nTo protect that right, every unjustifiable intrusion by\nthe Government upon the privacy of the individual\nwhatever the means employed, must be deemed a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment. And the use, as\nevidence in a criminal proceeding, of facts\nascertained by such intrusion must be deemed a\nviolation of the Fifth.”\nBrandeis, J.’s view was held as being the correct view of\nthe law in Katz (supra).\n70.   A large number of judgments of the U.S. Supreme Court\nsince Katz (supra) have recognized the right to privacy as\nfalling in one or other of the clauses of the Bill of Rights in the\nU.S. Constitution. Thus, in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S.\n479 (1965), Douglas, J.’s majority opinion found that the right to\nprivacy was contained in the penumbral regions of the First,\nThird, Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\nGoldberg, J. found this right to be embedded in the Ninth\nAmendment which states that certain rights which are not\nenumerated are nonetheless recognized as being reserved to\nthe people. White, J. found this right in the due process clause\n82\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits the deprivation\nof a person’s liberty without following due process. This view of\nthe law was recognized and applied in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S.\n113 (1973), in which a woman’s right to choose for herself\nwhether or not to abort a fetus was established, until the fetus\nwas found “viable”. Other judgments also recognized this right\nof independence of choice in personal decisions relating to\nmarriage, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.\nS. 1\n,\n12\n, 87 S.Ct. 1817,\n1823, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967); procreation, Skinner v.\nOklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541-542, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 1113-1114,\n86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942); contraception, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405\nU.S. 438, 453-454, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 1038-1039, 31 L.Ed.2d 349\n(1972), family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321\nU.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 442, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944); and\nchild rearing and education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268\nU.S. 510, 535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925).\n71.   In a recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in United\nStates v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400 (2012), the U.S. Supreme\nCourt’s majority judgment traces the right of privacy through the\n83\nlabyrinth of case law in Part II of Scalia, J.’s opinion, and\nregards it as a constitutionally protected right.\n72.   Based upon the prevalent thinking of the U.S. Supreme\nCourt, a   seminal    judgment     was    delivered   by   Mathew,\nJ. in\nGobind\n(supra).\nThis judgment dealt with the M.P. Police\nRegulations, similar to the Police Regulations contained in\nKharak Singh (supra).        After setting out the majority and\nminority opinions in the said judgment, Mathew, J. went on to\ndiscuss the U.S. Supreme Court judgments in Griswold (supra)\nand Roe (supra). In a very instructive passage the learned\nJudge held:\n“22. There can be no doubt that privacy-dignity\nclaims deserve to be examined with care and to be\ndenied only when an important countervailing\ninterest is shown to be superior. If the Court does\nfind that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a\nfundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must\nsatisfy the compelling State interest test. Then the\nquestion would be whether a State interest is of\nsuch paramount importance as would justify an\ninfringement of the right. Obviously, if the\nenforcement of morality were held to be a\ncompelling as well as a permissible State interest,\nthe characterization of a claimed right as a\nfundamental privacy right would be of far less\nsignificance. The question whether enforcement of\nmorality is a State interest sufficient to justify the\ninfringement of a fundamental privacy right need not\n84\nbe considered for the purpose of this case and\ntherefore we refuse to enter the controversial thicket\nwhether enforcement of morality is a function of\nState.\n23. Individual autonomy, perhaps the central\nconcern of any system of limited government, is\nprotected in part under our Constitution by explicit\nconstitutional guarantees. In the application of the\nConstitution our contemplation cannot only be of\nwhat has been but what may be. Time works\nchanges and brings into existence new conditions.\nSubtler and far reaching means of invading privacy\nwill make it possible to be heard in the street what is\nwhispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a definition\nof privacy raises serious questions about the\npropriety of judicial reliance on a right that is not\nexplicit in the Constitution. Of course, privacy\nprimarily concerns the individuals. It therefore\nrelates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty.\nThe most serious advocate of privacy must confess\nthat there are serious problems of defining the\nessence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in\nautonomy must also be placed in the context of\nother rights and values.\n24. Any right to privacy must encompass and\nprotect the personal intimacies of the home, the\nfamily marriage, motherhood, procreation and child\nrearing. This catalogue approach to the question is\nobviously not as instructive as it does not give\nanalytical picture of distinctive characteristics of the\nright of privacy. Perhaps, the only suggestion that\ncan be offered as unifying principle underlying the\nconcept has been the assertion that a claimed right\nmust be a fundamental right implicit in the concept\nof ordered liberty.\n27. There are two possible theories for protecting\nprivacy of home. The first is that activities in the\n85\nhome harm others only to the extent that they cause\noffence resulting from the mere thought that\nindividuals might be engaging in such activities and\nthat such ‘harm’ is not constitutionally protectable by\nthe State. The second is that individuals need a\nplace of sanctuary where they can be free from\nsocietal control. The importance of such a sanctuary\nis that individuals can drop the mask, desist for a\nwhile from projecting on the world the image they\nwant to be accepted as themselves, an image that\nmay reflect the values of their peers rather than the\nrealities of their natures.\n28. The right to privacy in any event will\nnecessarily have to go through a process of case-\nby-case development. Therefore, even assuming\nthat the right to personal liberty, the right to move\nfreely throughout the territory of India and the\nfreedom of speech create an independent right of\nprivacy as an emanation from them which one can\ncharacterize as a fundamental right, we do not think\nthat the right is absolute.”\n(at pages 155-157)\nThe Police Regulations were, however, not struck down,\nbut   were    termed   as   being   perilously   close   to     being\nunconstitutional.\n73.   Shri Sundaram has brought to our notice the fact that\nMathew, J. did not declare privacy as a fundamental right. By\nthis judgment, he reached certain conclusions on the\nassumption that it was a fundamental right. He is correct in this\nsubmission.    However, this would not take the matter very\n86\nmuch further inasmuch as even though the later judgments\nhave referred to\nGobind\n(supra) as the starting point of the\nfundamental right to privacy, in our view, for the reasons given\nby us in this judgment, even dehors\nGobind\n(supra) these\ncases can be supported on the ground that there exists a\nfundamental right to privacy.\n74.\nIn\nR. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu\n, (1994) 6 SCC\n632, this Court had to decide on the rights of privacy vis-a-vis\nthe freedom of the press, and in so doing, referred to a large\nnumber of judgments and arrived at the following conclusion:\n“26. We may now summarise the broad principles\nflowing from the above discussion:\n(1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life\nand liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country\nby\nArticle 21.\nIt is a “right to be let alone”. A citizen\nhas a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his\nfamily, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-\nbearing and education among other matters. None\ncan publish anything concerning the above matters\nwithout his consent—whether truthful or otherwise\nand whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he\nwould be violating the right to privacy of the person\nconcerned and would be liable in an action for\ndamages. Position may, however, be different, if a\nperson voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or\nvoluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n87\n(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception,\nthat any publication concerning the aforesaid\naspects     becomes      unobjectionable   if    such\npublication is based upon public records including\ncourt records. This is for the reason that once a\nmatter becomes a matter of public record, the right\nto privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a\nlegitimate subject for comment by press and media\namong others. We are, however, of the opinion that\nin the interests of decency [\nArticle 19(2)]\nan\nexception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a\nfemale who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap,\nabduction or a like offence should not further be\nsubjected to the indignity of her name and the\nincident being publicised in press/media.\n(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1)\nabove—indeed, this is not an exception but an\nindependent rule. In the case of public officials, it is\nobvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the\nremedy of action for damages is simply not\navailable with respect to their acts and conduct\nrelevant to the discharge of their official duties. This\nis so even where the publication is based upon facts\nand statements which are not true, unless the\nofficial establishes that the publication was made\n(by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth.\nIn such a case, it would be enough for the\ndefendant (member of the press or media) to prove\nthat he acted after a reasonable verification of the\nfacts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what\nhe has written is true. Of course, where the\npublication is proved to be false and actuated by\nmalice or personal animosity, the defendant would\nhave no defence and would be liable for damages.\nIt is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to\nthe discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys\nthe same protection as any other citizen, as\nexplained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no\nreiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the\n88\npower to punish for contempt of court and\nParliament and legislatures protected as their\nprivileges are by\nArticles 105\nand\n104\nrespectively\nof the Constitution of India, represent exceptions to\nthis rule.\n(4) So far as the Government, local authority and\nother    organs      and   institutions   exercising\ngovernmental power are concerned, they cannot\nmaintain a suit for damages for defaming them.\n(5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean\nthat\nOfficial Secrets Act, 1923\n, or any similar\nenactment or provision having the force of law does\nnot bind the press or media.\n(6) There is no law empowering the State or its\nofficials to prohibit, or to impose a prior restraint\nupon the press/media.”10\n(at pages 649-651)\n75.      Similarly, in\nPUCL v. Union of India\n, (1997) 1 SCC 301,\nthis Court dealt with telephone tapping as follows:\n“17. We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding\nthat right to privacy is a part of the right to “life” and\n“personal liberty” enshrined under\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution. Once the facts in a given case\nconstitute a right to privacy,\nArticle 21\nis attracted.\nThe said right cannot be curtailed “except according\nto procedure established by law”.\n18. The right to privacy—by itself—has not been\nidentified under the Constitution. As a concept it\nmay be too broad and moralistic to define it\njudicially. Whether right to privacy can be claimed or\nhas been infringed in a given case would depend on\n10\nIt will be noticed that this judgment grounds the right of privacy in\nArticle 21.\nHowever, the Court was dealing\nwith the aforesaid right not in the context of State action, but in the context of press freedom.\n89\nthe facts of the said case. But the right to hold a\ntelephone conversation in the privacy of one’s home\nor office without interference can certainly be\nclaimed as “right to privacy”. Conversations on the\ntelephone are often of an intimate and confidential\ncharacter. Telephone conversation is a part of\nmodern man’s life. It is considered so important that\nmore and more people are carrying mobile\ntelephone instruments in their pockets. Telephone\nconversation is an important facet of a man’s private\nlife. Right to privacy would certainly include\ntelephone conversation in the privacy of one’s home\nor    office.    Telephone-tapping      would,     thus,\ninfract\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India unless it\nis permitted under the procedure established by\nlaw.”\n(at page 311)\nThe Court then went on to apply\nArticle 17\nof the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 which\nrecognizes the right to privacy and also referred to\nArticle 12\nof\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 which is in the\nsame terms. It then imported these international law concepts\nto interpret\nArticle 21\nin accordance with these concepts.\n76.\nIn\nSharda v. Dharmpal\n(supra), this Court was\nconcerned with whether a medical examination could be\nordered by a Court in a divorce proceeding. After referring to\nsome of the judgments of this Court and the U.K. Courts, this\nCourt held:\n90\n“81. To sum up, our conclusions are:\n1. A matrimonial court has the power to order a\nperson to undergo medical test.\n2. Passing of such an order by the court would not\nbe in violation of the right to personal liberty\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Indian Constitution.\n3. However, the court should exercise such a power\nif the applicant has a strong prima facie case and\nthere is sufficient material before the court. If\ndespite the order of the court, the respondent\nrefuses to submit himself to medical examination,\nthe court will be entitled to draw an adverse\ninference against him.”\n(at page 524)\nIn\nCanara Bank\n(supra), this Court struck down Section\n73 of the Andhra Pradesh Stamp Act, as it concluded that the\ninvoluntary impounding of documents under the said provision\nwould be violative of the fundamental right of privacy contained\nin\nArticle 21.\nThe Court exhaustively went into the issue and\ncited many U.K. and U.S. judgments.          After so doing, it\nanalysed some of this Court’s judgments and held:\n“53. Once we have accepted in Gobind [(1975) 2\nSCC 148 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 468] and in later cases\nthat the right to privacy deals with “persons and not\nplaces”, the documents or copies of documents of\nthe customer which are in a bank, must continue to\nremain confidential vis-a-vis the person, even if they\nare no longer at the customer’s house and have\nbeen voluntarily sent to a bank. If that be the correct\n91\nview of the law, we cannot accept the line of Miller,\n425 US 435 (1976), in which the Court proceeded\non the basis that the right to privacy is referable to\nthe right of “property” theory. Once that is so, then\nunless there is some probable or reasonable cause\nor reasonable basis or material before the Collector\nfor reaching an opinion that the documents in the\npossession of the bank tend to secure any duty or\nto prove or to lead to the discovery of any fraud or\nomission in relation to any duty, the search or taking\nnotes or extracts therefore, cannot be valid. The\nabove safeguards must necessarily be read into the\nprovision relating to search and inspection and\nseizure so as to save it from any unconstitutionality.\n56.\nIn\nSmt. Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India\n,\n(1978) 1 SCC 248, a seven-Judge Bench decision,\nP.N. Bhagwati, J. (as His Lordship then was) held\nthat the expression “personal liberty” in\nArticle 21\nis\nof the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of\nrights which go to constitute the personal liberty of\nman and some of them have been raised to the\nstatus of distinct fundamental rights and given\nadditional protection under\nArticle 19 (emphasis\nsupplied).\nAny law interfering with personal liberty of\na person must satisfy a triple test: (i) it must\nprescribe a procedure; (ii) the procedure must\nwithstand the test of one or more of the fundamental\nrights conferred under\nArticle 19\nwhich may be\napplicable in a given situation; and (iii) it must also\nbe liable to be tested with reference to\nArticle 14.\nAs\nthe test propounded by\nArticle 14\npervades\nArticle\n21\nas well, the law and procedure authorizing\ninterference with personal liberty and right of privacy\nmust also be right and just and fair and not arbitrary,\nfanciful or oppressive.\nIf the procedure prescribed\ndoes not satisfy the requirement of\nArticle 14\nit\nwould be no procedure at all within the meaning\nof Article 21.”\n(at pages 523 and 524)\n92\nIn\nSelvi v. State of Karnataka\n(supra), this Court went\ninto an in depth analysis of the right in the context of lie detector\ntests used to detect alleged criminals. A number of judgments\nof this Court were examined and this Court, recognizing the\ndifference between privacy in a physical sense and the privacy\nof   one’s   mental    processes,     held   that   both   received\nconstitutional protection. This was stated in the following words:\n“224. Moreover, a distinction must be made\nbetween the character of restraints placed on the\nright to privacy. While the ordinary exercise of police\npowers contemplates restraints of a physical nature\nsuch as the extraction of bodily substances and the\nuse of reasonable force for subjecting a person to a\nmedical examination, it is not viable to extend these\npolice powers to the forcible extraction of\ntestimonial responses. In conceptualising the “right\nto privacy” we must highlight the distinction between\nprivacy in a physical sense and the privacy of one’s\nmental processes.\n225. So far, the judicial understanding of privacy in\nour country has mostly stressed on the protection of\nthe body and physical spaces from intrusive actions\nby the State. While the scheme of criminal\nprocedure as well as evidence law mandates\ninterference with physical privacy through statutory\nprovisions that enable arrest, detention, search and\nseizure among others, the same cannot be the\nbasis for compelling a person “to impart personal\nknowledge about a relevant fact”. The theory of\ninterrelationship of rights mandates that the right\nagainst self-incrimination should also be read as a\n93\ncomponent of “personal liberty” under Article\n21. Hence, our understanding of the “right to\nprivacy” should account for its intersection\nwith\nArticle 20(3).\nFurthermore, the “rule against\ninvoluntary confessions” as embodied in\nSections\n24\n,\n25\n,\n26\nand\n27\nof the Evidence Act, 1872 seeks\nto serve both the objectives of reliability as well as\nvoluntariness of testimony given in a custodial\nsetting. A conjunctive reading of\nArticles 20(3)\nand\n21\nof the Constitution along with the principles of\nevidence law leads us to a clear answer. We must\nrecognise the importance of personal autonomy in\naspects such as the choice between remaining\nsilent and speaking. An individual’s decision to\nmake a statement is the product of a private choice\nand there should be no scope for any other\nindividual to interfere with such autonomy,\nespecially in circumstances where the person faces\nexposure to criminal charges or penalties.”\n(at pages 369-370)\n77.   All this leads to a discussion on what exactly is the\nfundamental right of privacy – where does it fit in Chapter III of\nthe Constitution, and what are the parameters of its\nconstitutional protection.\n78.   In an instructive article reported in Volume 64 of the\nCalifornia Law Review, written in 1976, Gary L. Bostwick\nsuggested that the right to privacy in fact encompasses three\nseparate and distinct rights. According to the learned author,\nthese three components are the components of repose,\n94\nsanctuary, and intimate decision. The learned author puts it\nthus (at pages 1482-1483):-\n“The extent of constitutional protection is not the\nonly distinction between the types of privacy. Each\nzone protects a unique type of human transaction.\nRepose maintains the actor’s peace; sanctuary\nallows an individual to keep some things private,\nand intimate decision grants the freedom to act in\nan autonomous fashion. Whenever a generalized\nclaim to privacy is put forward without distinguishing\ncarefully between the transactional types, parties\nand courts alike may become hopelessly muddled\nin obscure claims. The clear standards that appear\nwithin each zone are frequently ignored by\nclaimants anxious to retain some aspect of their\npersonal liberty and by courts impatient with the\nindiscriminate invocation of privacy.\nFinally, it should be recognized that the right of\nprivacy is a continually evolving right. This\nComment has attempted to show what findings of\nfact will lead to the legal conclusion that a person\nhas a right to privacy. Yet the same findings of fact\nmay lead to different conclusions of law as time\npasses and society’s ideas change about how much\nprivacy is reasonable and what kinds of decisions\nare best left to individual choice. Future litigants\nmust look to such changes in community concerns\nand national acceptance of ideas as harbingers of\ncorresponding changes in the contours of the zones\nof privacy.”\n79.   Shortly thereafter, in 1977, an instructive judgment is to\nbe found in Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589 at 598 and 599 by\nthe U.S. Supreme Court. This case dealt with a legislation by\n95\nthe State of New York in which the State, in a centralized\ncomputer file, registered the names and addresses of all\npersons    who    have      obtained,   pursuant   to    a   Doctor’s\nprescription, certain drugs for which there is both a lawful and\nunlawful market. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the statute,\nfinding that it would seem clear that the State’s vital interest in\ncontrolling the distribution of dangerous drugs would support\nthe legislation at hand. In an instructive footnote – 23 to the\njudgment, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the right to\nprivacy was grounded after Roe (supra) in the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s       concept    of   personal liberty.     Having thus\ngrounded the right, the U.S. Supreme Court in a very significant\npassage stated:\n“At the very least, it would seem clear that the\nState’s vital interest in controlling the distribution of\ndangerous drugs would support a decision to\nexperiment with new techniques for control…\n…Appellees contend that the statute invades a\nconstitutionally protected “zone of privacy.” The\ncases sometimes characterized as protecting\n“privacy” have in fact involved at least two different\nkinds of interests. One is the individual interest in\navoiding disclosure of personal matters, and\nanother is the interest in independence in making\ncertain kinds of important decisions.”\n96\n80.   In fact, in the Constitution of South Africa of 1996, which\nConstitution was framed after apartheid was thrown over by the\nSouth African people, the right to privacy has been expressly\ndeclared as a fundamental freedom as follows:\n“10. Human dignity\nEveryone has inherent dignity and the right to have\ntheir dignity respected and protected.\n12. Freedom and security of the person\n(1) Everyone has the right to freedom and security\nof the person, which includes the right—\n(a) not to be deprived of freedom arbitrarily or\nwithout just cause;\n(b) not to be detained without trial;\n(c) to be free from all forms of violence from either\npublic or private sources;\n(d) not to be tortured in any way; and\n(e) not to be treated or punished in a cruel, inhuman\nor degrading way.\n(2) Everyone has the right to bodily and\npsychological integrity, which includes the right—\n(a) to make decisions concerning reproduction;\n(b) to security in and control over their body; and\n(c) not to be subjected to medical or scientific\nexperiments without their informed consent.\n14. Privacy\nEveryone has the right to privacy, which includes\nthe right not to have—\n97\n(a) their person or home searched;\n(b) their property searched;\n(c) their possessions seized; or\n(d) the privacy of their communications infringed.”\nThe Constitutional Court of South Africa in NM & Ors. v.\nSmith & Ors., 2007 (5) SA 250 (CC), had this to say about the\nfundamental right to privacy recognized by the South African\nConstitution:\n“131. The right to privacy recognizes the\nimportance of protecting the sphere of our personal\ndaily lives from the public. In so doing, it highlights\nthe inter-relationship between privacy, liberty and\ndignity as the key constitutional rights which\nconstruct our understanding of what it means to be\na human being. All these rights are therefore inter-\ndependent and mutually reinforcing. We value\nprivacy for this reason at least – that the\nconstitutional conception of being a human being\nasserts and seeks to foster the possibility of human\nbeings choosing how to live their lives within the\noverall framework of a broader community. The\nprotection of this autonomy, which flows from our\nrecognition of individual human worth, presupposes\npersonal space within which to live this life.\n132. This first reason for asserting the value of\nprivacy therefore lies in our constitutional\nunderstanding of what it means to be a human\nbeing. An implicit part of this aspect of privacy is\nthe right to choose what personal information of\nours is released into the public space. The more\n98\nintimate that information, the more important it is in\nfostering privacy, dignity and autonomy that an\nindividual makes the primary decision whether to\nrelease the information. That decision should not\nbe made by others. This aspect of the right to\nprivacy must be respected by all of us, not only the\nstate...”\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n81.   In the Indian context, a fundamental right to privacy would\ncover at least the following three aspects:\n• Privacy that involves the person i.e. when there is some\ninvasion by the State of a person’s rights relatable to\nhis physical body, such as the right to move freely;\n• Informational privacy which does not deal with a\nperson’s body but deals with a person’s mind, and\ntherefore recognizes that an individual may have\ncontrol over the dissemination of material that is\npersonal to him. Unauthorised use of such information\nmay, therefore lead to infringement of this right; and\n• The privacy of choice, which protects an individual’s\nautonomy over fundamental personal choices.\nFor instance, we can ground physical privacy or privacy relating\nto the body in\nArticles 19(1)(d)\nand (e) read with\nArticle 21;\n99\nground personal information privacy under\nArticle 21;\nand the\nprivacy of choice in\nArticles 19(1)(a)\nto (c), 20(3), 21 and 25.\nThe argument based on ‘privacy’ being a vague and nebulous\nconcept need not, therefore, detain us.\n82.   We have been referred to the Preamble of the\nConstitution, which can be said to reflect core constitutional\nvalues.   The core value of the nation being democratic, for\nexample, would be hollow unless persons in a democracy are\nable to develop fully in order to make informed choices for\nthemselves which affect their daily lives and their choice of how\nthey are to be governed.\n83.   In his well-known thesis “On Liberty”, John Stuart Mill, as\nfar back as in 1859, had this to say:\n“…. the sole end for which mankind are warranted,\nindividually or collectively, in interfering with the\nliberty of action of any of their number, is self-\nprotection. That the only purpose for which power\ncan be rightfully exercised over any member of a\ncivilised community, against his will, is to prevent\nharm to others. His own good, either physical or\nmoral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot\nrightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it\nwill be better for him to do so, because it will make\nhim happier, because, in the opinions of others, to\ndo so would be wise, or even right. These are good\n100\nreasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning\nwith him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but\nnot for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil\nin case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct\nfrom which it is desired to deter him must be\ncalculated to produce evil to someone else. The\nonly part of the conduct of any one, for which he is\namenable to society, is that which concerns others.\nIn the part which merely concerns himself, his\nindependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself,\nover his own body and mind, the individual is\nsovereign.\n(…)\nThis, then, is the appropriate region of human\nliberty. It comprises, first, the inward domain of\nconsciousness; demanding liberty of conscience in\nthe most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought\nand feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and\nsentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative,\nscientific, moral, or theological. The liberty of\nexpressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall\nunder a different principle, since it belongs to that\npart of the conduct of an individual which concerns\nother people; but, being almost of as much\nimportance as the liberty of thought itself, and\nresting in great part on the same reasons, is\npractically inseparable from it.         Secondly, the\nprinciple requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of\nframing the plan of our life to suit our own character;\nof doing as we like, subject to such consequences\nas may follow: without impediment from our fellow\ncreatures, so long as what we do does not harm\nthem, even though they should think our conduct\nfoolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from this liberty\nof each individual, follows the liberty, within the\nsame limits, of combination among individuals;\nfreedom to unite, for any purpose not involving harm\nto others: the persons combining being supposed to\nbe of full age, and not forced or deceived.\n101\nNo society in which these liberties are not, on the\nwhole, respected, is free, whatever may be its form\nor government; and none is completely free in which\nthey do not exist absolute and unqualified. The only\nfreedom which deserves the name, is that of\npursuing our own good in our own way, so long as\nwe do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or\nimpede their efforts to obtain it.”\nNoting the importance of liberty to individuality, Mill wrote:\n“It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is\nindividual in themselves, but by cultivating it, and\ncalling it forth, within the limits imposed by the rights\nand interests of others, that human beings become\na noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and\nas the works partake the character of those who do\nthem, by the same process human life also\nbecomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing\nmore abundant aliment to high thoughts and\nelevating feelings, and strengthening the tie which\nbinds every individual to the race, by making the\nrace infinitely better worth belonging to.             In\nproportion to the development of his individuality,\neach person becomes more valuable to himself,\nand is therefore capable of being more valuable to\nothers. There is a greater fullness of life about his\nown existence, and when there is more life in the\nunits there is more in the mass which is composed\nof them….. The means of development which the\nindividual loses by being prevented from gratifying\nhis inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly\nobtained at the expense of the development of other\npeople…. To be held to rigid rules of justice for the\nsake of others, develops the feelings and capacities\nwhich have the good of others for their object. But\nto be restrained in things not affecting their good, by\ntheir mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable,\nexcept such force of character as may unfold itself\nin resisting the restraint. If acquiesced in, it dulls\n102\nand blunts the whole nature. To give any fair play to\nthe nature of each, it is essential that different\npersons should be allowed to lead different lives.”\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n84.   “Liberty” in the Preamble to the Constitution, is said to be\nof thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. This cardinal\nvalue can be found strewn all over the fundamental rights\nchapter. It can be found in\nArticles 19(1)(a)\n, 20\n, 21\n, 25\nand\n26.\nAs is well known, this cardinal constitutional value has been\nborrowed from the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the\nCitizen of 1789, which defined “liberty” in\nArticle 4\nas follows:\n“Liberty consists in being able to do anything that\ndoes not harm others: thus, the exercise of the\nnatural rights of every man has no bounds other\nthan those that ensure to the other members of\nsociety the enjoyment of these same rights. These\nbounds may be determined only by Law.”\nEven in this limited sense, privacy begins where liberty ends –\nwhen others are harmed, in one sense, issues relating to\nreputation, restraints on physical locomotion etc. set in. It is,\ntherefore, difficult to accept the argument of Shri Gopal\n103\nSubramanium that “liberty” and “privacy” are interchangeable\nconcepts. Equally, it is difficult to accept the Respondents’\nsubmission that there is no concept of “privacy”, but only the\nconstitutional concept of “ordered liberty”. Arguments of both\nsides on this score must, therefore, be rejected.\n85.      But most important of all is the cardinal value of fraternity\nwhich assures the dignity of the individual.11 The dignity of the\nindividual encompasses the right of the individual to develop to\nthe full extent of his potential. And this development can only\nbe if an individual has autonomy over fundamental personal\nchoices and control over dissemination of personal information\nwhich may be infringed through an unauthorized use of such\ninformation. It is clear that\nArticle 21\n, more than any of the\nother Articles in the fundamental rights chapter, reflects each of\n11\nIn 1834, Jacques-Charles Dupont de l’Eure associated the three terms liberty, equality and fraternity together in\nthe Revue Républicaine, which he edited, as follows:\n“Any man aspires to liberty, to equality, but he cannot achieve it without the assistance of other\nmen, without fraternity.”\nMany of our decisions recognize human dignity as being an essential part of the fundamental rights chapter. For\nexample, see\nPrem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi Administration\n, (1980) 3 SCC 526 at paragraph 21,\nFrancis Coralie\nMullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi & Ors.\n, (1981) 1 SCC 608 at paragraphs 6, 7 and 8,\nBandhua\nMukti Morcha v. Union of India\n, (1984) 3 SCC 161 at paragraph 10,\nMaharashtra University of Health Sciences v.\nSatchikitsa Prasarak Mandal\n, (2010) 3 SCC 786 at paragraph 37,\nShabnam v. Union of India\n, (2015) 6 SCC 702 at\nparagraphs 12.4 and 14 and\nJeeja Ghosh v. Union of India\n, (2016) 7 SCC 761 at paragraph 37.\n104\nthese constitutional values in full, and is to be read in\nconsonance with these values and with the international\ncovenants that we have referred to. In the ultimate analysis,\nthe fundamental right of privacy, which has so many developing\nfacets, can only be developed on a case to case basis.\nDepending upon the particular facet that is relied upon, either\nArticle 21\nby itself or in conjunction with other fundamental\nrights would get attracted.\n86.   But this is not to say that such a right is absolute. This\nright is subject to reasonable regulations made by the State to\nprotect legitimate State interests or public interest. However,\nwhen it comes to restrictions on this right, the drill of various\nArticles to which the right relates must be scrupulously\nfollowed. For example, if the restraint on privacy is over\nfundamental personal choices that an individual is to make,\nState action can be restrained under\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle\n14\nif it is arbitrary and unreasonable; and under\nArticle 21\nread\nwith\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nonly if it relates to the subjects mentioned\nin\nArticle 19(2)\nand the tests\nlaid down by\nthis Court for such\nlegislation or subordinate legislation to pass muster under the\n105\nsaid Article. Each of the tests evolved by this Court, qua\nlegislation or executive action, under\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle\n14;\nor\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nin the aforesaid\nexamples must be met in order that State action pass muster.\nIn the ultimate analysis, the balancing act that is to be carried\nout between individual, societal and State interests must be left\nto the training and expertise of the judicial mind.\n87.   It is important to advert to one other interesting argument\nmade on the side of the petitioner. According to the petitioners,\neven in British India, the right to privacy was always legislatively\nrecognized. We were referred to the\nIndian Telegraph Act\nof\n1885, vintage and in particular\nSection 5\nthereof which reads as\nunder:-\n“5. (1)    On the occurrence of any public\nemergency, or in the interest of the public safety,\nthe Governor General in Council or a Local\nGovernment, or any officer specially authorized in\nthis behalf by the Governor General in Council,\nmay–\n(a) take temporary possession of any telegraph\nestablished, maintained or worked by any\nperson licensed under this Act; or\n(b) order that any message or class of messages\nto or from any person or class of persons, or\n106\nrelating to any particular subject, brought for\ntransmission by or transmitted or received by\nany telegraph, shall not be transmitted, or shall\nbe intercepted or detained, or shall be\ndisclosed to the Government or an officer\nthereof mentioned in the order.\n(2) If any doubt arises as to the existence of a\npublic emergency, or whether any act done under\nsub-section (1) was in the interest of the public\nsafety, a certificate signed by a Secretary to the\nGovernment of India or to the Local Government\nshall be conclusive proof on the point.”\nWe were also referred to\nSection 26\nof the Indian Post\nOffice Act, 1898 for the same purpose.\n“26. Power to intercept postal articles for public\ngood.— (1) On the occurrence of any public\nemergency, or in the interest of the public safety or\ntranquility, the Central Government, or a State\nGovernment, or any officer specially authorized in\nthis behalf by the Central or the State Government\nmay, by order in writing, direct that any postal article\nor class or description of postal articles in course of\ntransmission by post shall be intercepted or\ndetained, or shall be disposed of in such manner as\nthe authority issuing the order may direct.\n(2) If any doubt arises as to the existence of a public\nemergency, or as to whether any act done under\nsub-section (1) was in the interest of the public\nsafety or tranquility, a certificate of the Central\nGovernment or, as the case may be, of the State\nGovernment shall be conclusive proof on the point.”\n107\n88.   Coming to more recent times, the\nRight to Information\nAct, 2005\nin\nSection 8(1)(j)\nstates as follows:-\n“8. Exemption from disclosure of information.—\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act,\nthere shall be no obligation to give any citizen,—\n(a) to (i)   xxx   xxx   xxx\n(j)    information which relates to personal\ninformation the disclosure of which has not\nrelationship to any public activity or interest, or\nwhich would cause unwarranted invasion of the\nprivacy of the individual unless the Central Public\nInformation Officer or the State Public Information\nOfficer or the appellate authority, as the case may\nbe, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies\nthe disclosure of such information:\nProvided that the information, which cannot be\ndenied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall\nnot be denied to any person.”\nIt will be noticed that in this statutory provision, the\nexpression “privacy of the individual” is specifically mentioned.\nIn an illuminating judgment, reported as\nThalappalam Service\nCo-operative Bank Limited & Ors., v. State of Kerala & Ors.\n,\n(2013) 16 SCC 82, this Court dealt with the right to information\nas a facet of the freedom of speech guaranteed to every\nindividual. In certain instructive passages, this Court held:\n108\n“57. The right to privacy is also not expressly\nguaranteed under the Constitution of India.\nHowever, the Privacy Bill, 2011 to provide for the\nright to privacy to citizens of India and to regulate\nthe collection, maintenance and dissemination of\ntheir personal information and for penalization for\nviolation of such rights and matters connected\ntherewith, is pending. In several judgments\nincluding Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. (AIR 1963\nSC 1295 : (1963) 2 Cri LJ 329), R. Rajagopal v.\nState of T.N. (1994) 6 SCC 632, People’s Union for\nCivil Liberties v. Union of India\n(\n1997) 1 SCC 301\nand State of Maharashtra v. Bharat Shanti Lal Shah\n(2008) 13 SCC 5, this Court has recognized the\nright to privacy as a fundamental right emanating\nfrom\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India.\n58. The right to privacy is also recognized as a\nbasic human right under\nArticle 12\nof the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights Act, 1948, which\nstates as follows:\n“12. No one shall be subjected to\narbitrary interference with his privacy,\nfamily, home or correspondence, not to\nattack upon his honour and reputation.\nEveryone has the right to the protection\nof the law against such interference or\nattacks.”\n59.\nArticle 17\nof the\nInternational Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights Act, 1966\n, to which India is a\nparty also protects that right and states as follows:\n“17. (1) No one shall be subjected to\narbitrary or unlawful interference with his\nprivacy,      family,       home       and\ncorrespondence nor to unlawful attacks\non his honour and reputation.”\n109\n60. This Court in R. Rajagopal, (1994) 6 SCC 632\nheld as follows: (SCC pp. 649-50, para 26)\n“(1)… The right to privacy is implicit in\nthe right to life and liberty guaranteed to\nthe citizens of this country by Article\n21. It is a ‘right to be let alone’. A citizen\nhas a right to safeguard the privacy of\nhis     own,      his   family,     marriage,\nprocreation, motherhood, child bearing\nand education among other matters.”\n62. The public authority also is not legally obliged to\ngive or provide information even if it is held, or\nunder its control, if that information falls under\nclause (j) of sub-section (1) of\nSection 8\n.\nSection\n8(1)(j)\nis of considerable importance so far as this\ncase is concerned, hence given below, for ready\nreference:-\n“8. Exemption from disclosure of\ninformation – (1) Notwithstanding\nanything contained in this Act, there\nshall be no obligation to give any citizen\n–\n(a) to (i) xxx xxx xxx\n(j) information which relates to personal\ninformation the disclosure of which has\nno relationship to any public activity or\ninterest, or which would cause\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of\nthe individual unless the Central Public\nInformation Officer or the State Public\nInformation Officer or the appellate\nauthority, as the case may be, is\nsatisfied that the larger public interest\n110\njustifies the       disclosure     of    such\ninformation:\nProvided that the information which\ncannot be denied to Parliament or a\nState Legislature shall not be denied to\nany person.”\n63.\nSection 8\nbegins with a non obstante clause,\nwhich gives that section an overriding effect, in case\nof conflict, over the other provisions of the Act. Even\nif, there is any indication to the contrary, still there is\nno obligation on the public authority to give\ninformation to any citizen of what has been\nmentioned in clauses (a) to (j). The public authority,\nas already indicated, cannot access all the\ninformation from a private individual, but only those\ninformation which he is legally obliged to pass on to\na public authority by law, and also only those\ninformation to which the public authority can have\naccess in accordance with law. Even those\ninformation, if personal in nature, can be made\navailable only subject to the limitations provided\nin\nSection 8(j)\nof the RTI Act. Right to be left alone,\nas propounded in Olmstead v. United States [72 L\nEd 944 : 277 US 438 (1928)], is the most\ncomprehensive of the rights and most valued by\ncivilized man.\n64. Recognizing the fact that the right to privacy is a\nsacrosanct facet of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution, the\nlegislation has put a lot of safeguards to protect the\nrights under\nSection 8(j)\n, as already indicated. If the\ninformation sought for is personal and has no\nrelationship with any public activity or interest or it\nwill not subserve larger public interest, the public\nauthority or the officer concerned is not legally\nobliged to provide those information. Reference\nmay be made to a recent judgment of this Court\nin\nGirish Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central\nInformation Commissioner\n(2013) 1 SCC 212,\n111\nwherein this Court held that since there is no bona\nfide public interest in seeking information, the\ndisclosure of said information would cause\nunwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual\nunder\nSection 8(1)(j)\nof the Act. Further, if the\nauthority finds that information sought for can be\nmade available in the larger public interest, then the\nofficer should record his reasons in writing before\nproviding the information, because the person from\nwhom information is sought for, has also a right to\nprivacy guaranteed under\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution.”\n(at page 112-114)\n89.   There can be no doubt that counsel for the petitioners are\nright in their submission that the legislature has also recognized\nthe fundamental right of privacy and, therefore, it is too late in\nthe day to go back on this. Much water has indeed flowed\nunder the bridge since the decisions in M.P. Sharma (supra)\nand Kharak Singh (supra).\nThe Inalienable Nature of the Right to Privacy\n90.   Learned counsel for the petitioners also referred to\nanother important aspect of the right of privacy. According to\nlearned counsel for the petitioner this right is a natural law right\nwhich is inalienable.    Indeed, the reference order itself, in\nparagraph 12, refers to this aspect of the fundamental right\ncontained. It was, therefore, argued before us that given the\n112\ninternational conventions referred to hereinabove and the fact\nthat this right inheres in every individual by virtue of his being a\nhuman being, such right is not conferred by the Constitution but\nis only recognized and given the status of being fundamental.\nThere is no doubt that the petitioners are correct in this\nsubmission.           However, one important road block in the way\nneeds to be got over.\n91.\nIn\nAdditional District Magistrate, Jabalpur v. S.S.\nShukla\n, (1976) 2 SCC 521, a Constitution Bench of this Court\narrived at the conclusion (by majority) that\nArticle 21\nis the sole\nrepository of all rights to life and personal liberty, and, when\nsuspended, takes away those rights altogether.\nA remarkable dissent was that of Khanna,J.12\n12\nKhanna, J. was in line to be Chief Justice of India but was superseded because of this dissenting judgment. Nani\nPalkhivala in an article written on this great Judge’s supersession ended with a poignant sentence, “To the stature\nof such a man, the Chief Justiceship of India can add nothing.” Seervai, in his monumental treatise “Constitutional\nLaw of India” had to this to say:\n“53. If in this Appendix the dissenting judgment of Khanna J. has not been considered in detail, it\nis not for lack of admiration for the judgment, or the courage which he showed in delivering it\nregardless of the cost and consequences to himself. It cost him the Chief Justiceship of India, but\nit gained for him universal esteem not only for his courage but also for his inflexible judicial\nindependence. If his judgment is not considered in detail it is because under the theory of\nprecedents which we have adopted, a dissenting judgment, however valuable, does not lay down\nthe law and the object of a critical examination of the majority judgments in this Appendix was to\nshow that those judgments are untenable in law, productive of grave public mischief and ought\nto be overruled at the earliest opportunity. The conclusion which Justice Khanna has reached on\nthe effect of the suspension of\nArticle 21\nis correct. His reminder that the rule of law did not\nmerely mean giving effect to an enacted law was timely, and was reinforced by his reference to\nthe mass murders of millions of Jews in Nazi concentration camps under an enacted law.\n113\nThe learned Judge held:-\n“525. The effect of the suspension of the right to\nmove any court for the enforcement of the right\nconferred by\nArticle 21\n, in my opinion, is that when\na petition is filed in a court, the court would have to\nproceed upon the basis that no reliance can be\nplaced upon that article for obtaining relief from the\ncourt during the period of emergency. Question then\narises as to whether the rule that no one shall be\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty without the\nauthority of law still survives during the period of\nemergency despite the Presidential Order\nsuspending the right to move any court for the\nenforcement of the right contained in\nArticle 21.\nThe\nanswer to this question is linked with the answer to\nthe question as to whether\nArticle 21\nis the sole\nrepository of the right to life and personal liberty.\nAfter giving the matter my earnest consideration, I\nam of the opinion that\nArticle 21\ncannot be\nconsidered to be the sole repository of the right to\nlife and personal liberty. The right to life and\npersonal liberty is the most precious right of human\nbeings in civilised societies governed by the rule of\nlaw. Many modern Constitutions incorporate certain\nfundamental rights, including the one relating to\npersonal freedom. According to Blackstone, the\nabsolute rights of Englishmen were the rights of\npersonal security, personal liberty and private\nproperty.      The      American      Declaration    of\nIndependence (1776) states that all men are\ncreated equal, and among their inalienable rights\nare life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The\nSecond Amendment to the US Constitution refers\ninter alia to security of person, while the Fifth\nAmendment prohibits inter alia deprivation of life\nHowever, the legal analysis in this Chapter confirms his conclusion though on different grounds\nfrom those which he has given.” (at Appendix pg. 2229).\n114\nand liberty without due process, of law. The different\nDeclarations of Human Rights and fundamental\nfreedoms have all laid stress upon the sanctity of\nlife and liberty. They have also given expression in\nvarying words to the principle that no one shall be\nderived of his life or liberty without the authority of\nlaw. The International Commission of Jurists, which\nis affiliated to UNESCO, has been attempting with,\nconsiderable success to give material content to\n“the rule of law”, an expression used in the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. One of its\nmost notable achievements was the Declaration of\nDelhi, 1959. This resulted from a Congress held in\nNew Delhi attended by jurists from more than 50\ncountries, and was based on a questionnaire\ncirculated to 75,000 lawyers. “Respect for the\nsupreme value of human personality” was stated to\nbe the basis of all law (see page 21 of the\nConstitutional and Administrative Law by O. Hood\nPhillips, 3rd Ed.).\n531. I am unable to subscribe to the view that when\nright to enforce the right under\nArticle 21\nis\nsuspended, the result would be that there would be\nno remedy against deprivation of a person’s life or\nliberty by the State even though such deprivation is\nwithout the authority of law or even in flagrant\nviolation of the provisions of law. The right not to be\ndeprived of one’s life or liberty without the authority\nof law was not the creation of the Constitution. Such\nright existed before the Constitution came into force.\nThe fact that the framers of the Constitution made\nan aspect of such right a part of the fundamental\nrights did not have the effect of exterminating the\nindependent identity of such right and of making\nArticle 21\nto be the sole repository of that right. Its\nreal effect was to ensure that a law under which a\nperson can be deprived of his life or personal liberty\nshould prescribe a procedure for such deprivation\n115\nor, according to the dictum\nlaid down by\nMukherjea,\nJ. in Gopalan’s case, such law should be a valid law\nnot violative of fundamental rights guaranteed by\nPart III of the Constitution. Recognition as\nfundamental right of one aspect of the pre-\nconstitutional right cannot have the effect of making\nthings less favourable so far as the sanctity of life\nand personal liberty is concerned compared to the\nposition if an aspect of such right had not been\nrecognised as fundamental right because of the\nvulnerability of fundamental rights accruing from\nArticle 359.\nI am also unable to agree that in view of\nthe Presidential Order in the matter of sanctity of life\nand liberty, things would be worse off compared to\nthe state of law as it existed before the coming into\nforce of the Constitution.”\n(at pages 747 and 751)\n92.   According to us this is a correct enunciation of the law for\nthe following reasons:\n(i)   It   is   clear   that   the   international   covenants   and\ndeclarations to which India was a party, namely, the 1948\nDeclaration and the 1966 Covenant both spoke of the\nright to life and liberty as being “inalienable”. Given the\nfact that this has to be read as being part of\nArticle 21\nby\nvirtue of the judgments referred to supra, it is clear that\nArticle 21\nwould, therefore, not be the sole repository of\nthese human rights but only reflect the fact that they were\n116\n“inalienable”; that they inhere in every human being by\nvirtue of the person being a human being;\n(ii)   Secondly, developments after this judgment have also\nmade it clear that the majority judgments are no longer\ngood law and that Khanna, J.’s dissent is the correct\nversion of the law.\nSection 2(1)(d)\nof the Protection of\nHuman Rights Act, 1993 recognises that the right to life,\nliberty, equality and dignity referable to international\ncovenants and enforceable by Courts in India are “human\nrights”. And international covenants expressly state that\nthese rights are ‘inalienable’ as they inhere in persons\nbecause they are human beings.\nIn\nI.R. Coelho\n(supra),\nthis Court noticed in paragraph 29 that, “The decision in\nADM Jabalpur, (1976) 2 SCC 521, about the restrictive\nreading of the right to life and liberty stood impliedly\noverruled   by   various   subsequent   decisions.”,   and\nexpressly held that these rights are natural rights that\ninhere in human beings thus:-\n“61. The approach in the interpretation of\nfundamental rights has been evidenced in a\n117\nrecent case\nM. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n,\n(2006) 8 SCC 212, in which the Court noted:\n“20. This principle of interpretation is\nparticularly apposite to the interpretation of\nfundamental rights. It is a fallacy to regard\nfundamental rights as a gift from the State to\nits citizens. Individuals possess basic human\nrights independently of any constitution by\nreason of the basic fact that they are\nmembers of the human race. These\nfundamental rights are important as they\npossess intrinsic value. Part III of the\nConstitution does not confer fundamental\nrights. It confirms their existence and gives\nthem protection. Its purpose is to withdraw\ncertain subjects from the area of political\ncontroversy to place them beyond the reach of\nmajorities and officials and to establish them\nas legal principles to be applied by the courts.\nEvery right has a content. Every foundational\nvalue is put in Part III as a fundamental right\nas it has intrinsic value. The converse does\nnot apply. A right becomes a fundamental\nright because it has foundational value. Apart\nfrom the principles, one has also to see the\nstructure of the article in which the\nfundamental        value    is      incorporated.\nFundamental right is a limitation on the power\nof the State. A Constitution, and in particular\nthat of it which protects and which entrenches\nfundamental rights and freedoms to which all\npersons in the State are to be entitled is to be\ngiven a generous and purposive construction.\nIn\nSakal Papers (P) Ltd. v. Union of India\n[AIR\n1962 SC 305 : (1962) 3 SCR 842], this Court\nhas held that while considering the nature and\ncontent of fundamental rights, the Court must\nnot be too astute to interpret the language in a\nliteral sense so as to whittle them down. The\nCourt must interpret the Constitution in a\n118\nmanner which would enable the citizens to\nenjoy the rights guaranteed by it in the fullest\nmeasure.\nAn instance of literal and narrow\ninterpretation of a vital fundamental right in the\nIndian Constitution is the early decision of the\nSupreme Court in\nA.K. Gopalan v. State of\nMadras\n[AIR 1950 SC 27 : 1950 SCR 88 :\n1950 Cri LJ 1383].\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution provides that no person shall be\ndeprived of his life and personal liberty except\naccording to procedure established by law.\nThe Supreme Court by a majority held that\n‘procedure established by law’ means any\nprocedure established by law made by the\nParliament or the legislatures of the State.\nThe Supreme Court refused to infuse the\nprocedure with principles of natural justice. It\nconcentrated solely upon the existence of\nenacted law. After three decades, the\nSupreme Court overruled its previous decision\nin\nA.K. Gopalan [A.K. Gopalan v. State of\nMadras\n(AIR 1950 SC 27 : 1950 SCR 88 :\n1950 Cri LJ 1383)] and held in its landmark\njudgment in\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n,\n(1978) 1 SCC 248, that the procedure\ncontemplated by\nArticle 21\nmust answer the\ntest of reasonableness. The\nCourt further held\nthat the procedure should also be in\nconformity with the principles of natural\njustice. This example is given to demonstrate\nan instance of expansive interpretation of a\nfundamental right. The expression ‘life’ in\nArticle 21\ndoes not connote merely physical or\nanimal existence. The right to life includes\nright to live with human dignity. This Court has\nin numerous cases deduced fundamental\nfeatures which are not specifically mentioned\nin Part III on the principle that certain\nunarticulated rights are implicit in the\nenumerated guarantees.”\n119\n(at pages 85-86)\n(iii)   Seervai in a trenchant criticism of the majority judgment\nstates as follows:\n“30. The result of our discussion so far may\nbe stated thus:\nArticle 21\ndoes not confer a\nright to life or personal liberty:\nArticle 21\nassumes or recognizes the fact that those\nrights exist and affords protection against the\ndeprivation of those rights to the extent there\nprovided.       The expression “procedure\nestablished by law” does not mean merely a\nprocedural law but must also include\nsubstantive laws. The word “law” must mean\na valid law, that is, a law within the legislative\ncompetence of the legislature enacting it,\nwhich law does not violate the limitations\nimposed on legislative power by fundamental\nrights. “Personal liberty” means the liberty of\nthe person from external restraint or coercion.\nThus\nArticle 21\nprotects life and personal\nliberty by putting restrictions on legislative\npower, which under\nArticles 245\nand\n246\nis\nsubject to the provisions of “this Constitution”,\nand therefore subject to fundamental rights.\nThe precise nature of this protection is difficult\nto state, first because among other things,\nsuch protection is dependent on reading\nArticle 21\nalong with other Articles conferring\nfundamental rights, such as\nArticles 14\n, 20\nand\n22(1)\nand\n(2);\nand, secondly, because\nfundamental rights from their very nature refer\nto ordinary laws which deal with the subject\nmatter of those rights.\n31. The right to life and personal liberty\nwhich inheres in the body of a living person is\nrecognized and protected not merely by\n120\nArticle 21\nbut by the civil and criminal laws of\nIndia, and it is unfortunate that in the Habeas\nCorpus Case this aspect of the matter did not\nreceive the attention which it deserved.\nNeither the Constitution nor any law confers\nthe right to life. That right arises from the\nexistence of a living human body. The most\nfamous remedy for securing personal liberty,\nthe writ of habeas corpus, requires the\nproduction before the court of the body of the\nperson alleged to be illegally detained. The\nConstitution gives protection against the\ndeprivation of life and personal liberty; so do\nthe civil and criminal laws in force in India…”\n(See, Seervai, Constitutional Law of India (4th\nEdition) Appendix pg. 2219).\nWe are of the view that the aforesaid statement made by\nthe learned author reflects the correct position in constitutional\nlaw. We, therefore, expressly overrule the majority judgments in\nADM Jabalpur (supra).\n93.   Before parting with this subject, we may only indicate that\nthe majority opinion was done away with by the Constitution’s\n44th Amendment two years after the judgment was delivered.\nBy that Amendment,\nArticle 359\nwas amended to state that\nwhere a proclamation of emergency is in operation, the\nPresident may by order declare that the right to move any Court\nfor the enforcement of rights conferred by Part III of the\n121\nConstitution may remain suspended for the period during which\nsuch proclamation is in force, excepting\nArticles 20\nand\n21.\nOn\nthis score also, it is clear that the right of privacy is an\ninalienable human right which inheres in every person by virtue\nof the fact that he or she is a human being.\nConclusion\n94.   This reference is answered by stating that the inalienable\nfundamental right to privacy resides in\nArticle 21\nand other\nfundamental freedoms contained in Part III of the Constitution\nof India. M.P. Sharma (supra) and the majority in Kharak\nSingh (supra), to the extent that they indicate to the contrary,\nstand overruled. The later judgments of this Court recognizing\nprivacy as a fundamental right do not need to be revisited.\nThese cases are, therefore, sent back for adjudication on merits\nto the original Bench of 3 honourable Judges of this Court in\nlight of the judgment just delivered by us.\n…………………………......J.\n(R.F.

(C) No. 372 of 2017\nJUDGMENT\nAbhay Manohar Sapre, J.\n1)   I have had the benefit of reading the scholarly\nopinions of my esteemed learned brothers, Justice J.\nChelameswar, Justice S.A. Bobde, Justice Rohinton\nFali Nariman and Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud.\nHaving read them carefully, I have nothing more\nuseful to add to the reasoning and the conclusion\narrived at by my esteemed brothers in their respective\nopinions.\n2)   However, keeping in view the importance of the\nquestions referred to this Bench, I wish to add only\nfew words of concurrence of my own.\n3\n3)   In substance, two questions were referred to this\nNine Judge Bench, first, whether the law laid down in\nthe case of\nM.P.Sharma and others vs. Satish\nChandra, District Magistrate Delhi & Ors.\n, AIR 1954\nSC 300 and Kharak Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh\n& Ors. AIR 1963 SC 1295 insofar as it relates to the\n\"right to privacy of an individual”        is correct and\nsecond, whether \"right to privacy\" is a fundamental\nright under Part III of the Constitution of India?\n4)   Before I examine these two questions, it is\napposite   to   take   note   of   the   Preamble    to   the\nConstitution, which, in my view, has bearing on the\nquestions referred.\n5)   The Preamble to the Constitution reads as\nunder:-\n“WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having\nsolemnly resolved to constitute India into a\nSOVEREIGN        SOCIALIST         SECULAR\n4\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all\nits citizens:\nJUSTICE, social, economic and political;\nLIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith\nand worship;\nEQUALITY of status and of opportunity;\nAnd to promote among them all\nFRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the\nindividual and the unity and integrity of the\nNation;”\n6)   Perusal of the words in the Preamble would go to\nshow that every word used therein was cautiously\nchosen by the founding fathers and then these words\nwere arranged and accordingly placed in a proper\norder. Every word incorporated in the Preamble has\nsignificance and proper meaning.\n7)   The most important place of pride was given to\nthe \"People of India\" by using the expression, WE, THE\nPEOPLE OF INDIA, in the beginning of the Preamble.\nThe Constitution was accordingly adopted, enacted\nand then given to ourselves.\n5\n8)   The keynote of the Preamble was to lay emphasis\non two positive aspects – one, \"the Unity of the Nation\"\nand the second \"Dignity of the individual\".         The\nexpression \"Dignity\" carried with it moral and spiritual\nimports. It also implied an obligation on the part of\nthe Union to respect the personality of every citizen\nand create the conditions in which every citizen would\nbe left free to find himself/herself and attain self-\nfulfillment.\n9)   The incorporation of expression \"Dignity of the\nindividual\" in the Preamble was aimed essentially to\nshow explicit repudiation of what people of this\nCountry had inherited from the past. Dignity of the\nindividual was, therefore, always considered the prime\nconstituent of the fraternity, which assures the dignity\nto    every    individual.   Both    expressions    are\ninterdependent and intertwined.\n6\n10)   In my view, unity and integrity of the Nation\ncannot survive unless the dignity of every individual\ncitizen is guaranteed. It is inconceivable to think of\nunity and integration without the assurance to an\nindividual to preserve his dignity. In other words,\nregard and respect by every individual for the dignity\nof the other one brings the unity and integrity of the\nNation.\n11)   The    expressions   \"liberty“,   \"equality\"   and\n\"fraternity\" incorporated in the Preamble are not\nseparate entities. They have to be read in juxtaposition\nwhile dealing with the rights of the citizens. They, in\nfact, form a union. If these expressions are divorced\nfrom each other, it will defeat the very purpose of\ndemocracy.\n12)   In other words, liberty cannot be divorced from\nequality so also equality cannot be divorced from\n7\nliberty and nor can liberty and equality be divorced\nfrom    fraternity.   The   meaning   assigned   to   these\nexpressions has to be given due weightage while\ninterpreting Articles of Part III of the Constitution.\n13)    It is, therefore, the duty of the Courts and\nespecially this Court as sentinel on the qui vive to\nstrike a balance between the changing needs of the\nSociety and the protection of the rights of the citizens\nas and when the issue relating to the infringement of\nthe rights of the citizen comes up for consideration.\nSuch a balance can be achieved only through securing\nand protecting liberty, equality and fraternity with\nsocial and political justice to all the citizens under rule\nof law (see-S.S.\nBola & Ors. vs. B.D. Sardana & Ors\n.\n1997 (8) SCC 522).\n14)    Our Constitution has recognized certain existing\ncherished rights of an individual. These rights are\n8\nincorporated in different Articles of Part III of the\nConstitution under the heading-Fundamental Rights.\nIn so doing, some rights were incorporated and those,\nwhich were not incorporated, were read in Part III by\nprocess of judicial interpretation depending upon the\nnature of right asserted by the citizens on case-to-case\nbasis.\n15)   It was not possible for the framers of the\nConstitution to incorporate each and every right be\nthat a natural or common law right of an individual in\nPart III of the Constitution. Indeed, as we can see\nwhenever occasion arose in the last 50 years to decide\nas to whether any particular right alleged by the\ncitizen is a fundamental right or not, this Court with\nthe process of judicial interpretation recognized with\nremarkable   clarity   several   existing   natural   and\ncommon law rights of an individual as fundamental\n9\nrights falling in Part III though not defined in the\nConstitution. It was done keeping in view the fact that\nthe Constitution is a sacred living document and,\nhence, susceptible to appropriate interpretation of its\nprovisions based on changing needs of \"We, the\nPeople” and other well defined parameters.\n16)\nArticle 21\nis perhaps the smallest Article in terms\nof words (18) in the Constitution. It is the heart of the\nConstitution as was said by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. It\nreads as under: -\n“No person shall be deprived of his life or\npersonal   liberty   except    according to\nprocedure established by law.”\n17)   This Article is in Part III of the Constitution and\ndeals with Fundamental      rights of the citizens. It has\nbeen the subject matter of judicial interpretation by\nthis Court along with other Articles of Part III in\nseveral landmark cases beginning from\nA.K.Gopalan\n10\nvs. State of Madras\n, AIR 1950 SC 27 up to\nMohd Arif\n@ Ashfaq vs. Registrar\n, Supreme Court of India\n(2014) 9 SCC 737. In between this period, several\nlandmark judgments were rendered by this Court.\n18)   Part III of the Constitution and the true meaning\nof the expression \"personal liberty\" in\nArticle 21\nand\nwhat it encompasses was being debated all along in\nthese cases. The great Judges of this Court with their\nvast knowledge, matured thoughts, learning and with\ntheir inimitable style of writing coupled with the able\nassistance of great lawyers gradually went on to\nexpand the meaning of the golden words (personal\nliberty) with remarkable clarity and precision.\n19)   The learned Judges endeavored and expanded\nthe width of the fundamental rights and preserved the\nfreedom of the citizens.\nIn the process of the judicial\n11\nevolution, the law\nlaid down in\nsome earlier cases was\neither overruled or their correctness doubted.\n20)   It is a settled rule of interpretation as held in the\ncase of\nRustom Cavasjee Cooper vs. Union of India\n,\n(1970) 1 SCC 248 that the Court should always make\nattempt to expand the reach and ambit of the\nfundamental rights rather than to attenuate their\nmeaning and the content by process of judicial\nconstruction.\nSimilarly, it is also a settled principle of\nlaw laid down in His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati\nSripadagalvaru vs. State of Kerala & Anr., (1973) 4\nSCC 225      that the     Preamble is a      part of the\nConstitution and, therefore, while interpreting any\nprovision   of   the   Constitution   or   examining   any\nconstitutional issue or while determining the width or\nreach of any provision or when any ambiguity or\nobscurity is noticed in any provision, which needs to\n12\nbe clarified, or when the language admits of meaning\nmore than one, the Preamble to the Constitution may\nbe relied on as a remedy for mischief or/and to find\nout the true meaning of the relevant provision as the\ncase may be.\n21)   In my considered opinion, the two questions\nreferred herein along with few incidental questions\narising therefrom need to be examined carefully in the\nlight of law\nlaid down by\nthis Court in several decided\ncases.   Indeed, the answer to the questions can be\nfound in the law\nlaid down in\nthe decided cases of this\nCourt alone and one may not require taking the help of\nthe law\nlaid down by\nthe American Courts.\n22)   It is true that while interpreting our laws, the\nEnglish decisions do guide us in reaching to a\nparticular conclusion arising for consideration. The\nlaw reports also bear the testimony that this Court\n13\nespecially in its formative years has taken the help of\nEnglish cases for interpreting the provisions of our\nConstitution and other laws.\n23)   However, in the last seven decades, this Court\nhas interpreted our Constitution keeping in view the\nsocio, economic and political conditions of the Indian\nSociety, felt need of, We, the People of this Country\nand the Country in general in comparison to the\nconditions prevailing in other Countries.\n24)   Indeed, it may not be out of place to state that\nthis Court while interpreting the provisions of\nIndian\nCompanies    Act\n,   which   is   modeled    on   English\nCompany’s Act has cautioned that the Indian Courts\nwill have to adjust and adapt, limit or extend, the\nprinciples derived from English decisions, entitled as\nthey are to great respect, suiting the conditions to the\nIndian society as a whole. (See -\nHind Overseas (P)\n14\nLtd. vs. Raghunath Prasad Jhunjhunwala & Anr\n.\n(1976) 3 SCC 259).    The   questions    referred    need\nexamination in the light of these principles.\n25)   In my considered opinion, “right to privacy of any\nindividual” is essentially a natural right, which inheres\nin every human being by birth. Such right remains\nwith the human being till he/she breathes last. It is\nindeed inseparable and inalienable from human being.\nIn other words, it is born with the human being and\nextinguish with human being.\n26)   One cannot conceive an individual enjoying\nmeaningful life with dignity without such right. Indeed,\nit is one of those cherished rights, which every civilized\nsociety governed by rule of law always recognizes in\nevery human being and is under obligation to\nrecognize such rights in order to maintain and\npreserve the dignity of an individual regardless of\n15\ngender, race, religion, caste and creed. It is, of course,\nsubject to imposing certain reasonable restrictions\nkeeping in view the social, moral and compelling\npublic interest, which the State is entitled to impose\nby law.\n27)   “Right to privacy” is not defined in law except in\nthe dictionaries. The Courts, however, by process of\njudicial interpretation, has assigned meaning to this\nright in the context of specific issues involved on case-\nto-case basis.\n28)   The most popular meaning of “right to privacy”\nis - \"the right to be let alone”.\nIn\nGobind vs. State of\nMadhya     Pradesh    &   Anr.\n,   (1975)   2   SCC   148,\nK.K.Mathew, J. noticed multiple facets of this right\n(Para 21-25) and then gave a rule of caution while\nexamining the contours of such right on case-to-case\nbasis.\n16\n29)   In my considered view, the answer to the\nquestions can be found in the law\nlaid down by\nthis\nCourt in the cases beginning from\nRustom Cavasjee\nCooper\n(supra) followed by\nManeka Gandhi vs. Union\nof India & Anr.\n(1978) 1 SCC 248, People’s Union for\nCivil Liberties (PUCL) vs. Union of India & Anr.\n,\n(1997) 1 SCC 301, Gobind’s case (\nsupra), Mr. \"X\" vs.\nHospital ‘Z’\n(\n1998) 8 SCC 296, District Registrar &\nCollector, Hyderabad & Anr. vs. Canara Bank &\nOrs.\n, (2005) 1 SCC 496 and lastly in\nThalappalam\nService Coop. Bank Ltd. & Ors. vs. State of Kerala\n& Ors.\n, (2013) 16 SCC 82.\n30)   It is in these cases and especially the two –\nnamely,\nGobind\n(supra) and\nDistrict Registrar\n(supra),\ntheir Lordships very succinctly examined in great\ndetail the issue in relation to \"right to privacy\" in the\n17\nlight of Indian and American case law and various\ninternational conventions.\n31)   In\nGobind’\ncase, the learned Judge, K.K.Mathew\nJ. speaking for the Bench held and indeed rightly in\nPara 28 as under:\n“28. The right to privacy in any event will\nnecessarily have to go through a process of\ncase-by-case development. Therefore, even\nassuming that the right to personal liberty,\nthe right to move freely throughout the\nterritory of India and the freedom of speech\ncreate an independent right of privacy as an\nemanation from them which one can\ncharacterize as a fundamental right, we do\nnot think that the right is absolute.”\n32)   Similarly in the case of\nDistrict Registrar\n(supra),\nthe learned Chief Justice R.C.Lahoti (as His Lordship\nthen was) speaking for the Bench with his distinctive\nstyle of writing concluded in Para 39 as under :\n“39. We have referred in detail to the reasons\ngiven by Mathew, J. in Gobind to show that,\nthe right to privacy has been implied in\nArticles 19(1)(a)\nand (d) and\nArticle 21;\nthat,\nthe right is not absolute and that any State\n18\nintrusion can be a reasonable restriction only\nif it has reasonable basis or reasonable\nmaterials to support it.”\n33)   In all the aforementioned cases, the question of\n“right to privacy” was examined in the context of\nspecific grievances made by the citizens wherein their\nLordships, inter alia, ruled that firstly, “right to\nprivacy” has multiple facets and though such right can\nbe classified as a part of fundamental right emanating\nfrom\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nand (d) and\nArticle 21\n, yet it is not\nabsolute and secondly, it is always subject to certain\nreasonable restrictions on the basis of compelling\nsocial, moral and public interest and lastly, any such\nright when asserted by the citizen in the Court of law\nthen it has to go through a process of case-to-case\ndevelopment.\n34)   I, therefore, do not find any difficulty in tracing\nthe    \"right to privacy“ emanating from the two\n19\nexpressions of the       Preamble namely,         \"liberty   of\nthought, expression, belief, faith and worship\" and\n\"Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual“ and\nalso emanating from\nArticle 19 (1)(a)\nwhich gives to\nevery citizen    \"a freedom of speech and expression\"\nand further emanating from\nArticle 19(1)(d)\nwhich\ngives to every citizen            \"a right to move freely\nthroughout      the   territory    of   India\"   and   lastly,\nemanating from the expression “personal liberty\"\nunder\nArticle 21.\nIndeed, the right to privacy is inbuilt\nin these expressions and flows from each of them and\nin juxtaposition.\n35)   In view of foregoing discussion, my answer to\nquestion No. 2 is that “right to privacy” is a part of\nfundamental right of a citizen guaranteed under Part\nIII of the Constitution. However, it is not an absolute\nright but is subject to certain reasonable restrictions,\n20\nwhich the State is entitled to impose on the basis of\nsocial,     moral   and   compelling   public   interest   in\naccordance with law.\n36)    Similarly, I also hold that the “right to privacy”\nhas multiple facets, and, therefore, the same has to go\nthrough a process of case-to-case development as and\nwhen any citizen raises his grievance complaining of\ninfringement of his alleged right in accordance with\nlaw.\n37)    My    esteemed     learned   brothers,   Justice    J.\nChelameswar, Justice S.A. Bobde, Justice Rohinton\nFali Nariman and Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud have\nextensively dealt with question No. 1 in the context of\nIndian and American          Case   law   on    the subject\nsuccinctly. They have also dealt with in detail the\nvarious submissions of the learned senior counsel\nappearing for all the parties.\n21\n38)   I entirely agree with their reasoning and the\nconclusion on question No. 1 and hence do not wish to\nadd anything to what they have said in their respective\nscholarly opinions.\n39)   Some learned senior counsel appearing for the\npetitioners, however, argued that the law\nlaid down by\nthis Court in some earlier decided cases though not\nreferred for consideration be also overruled while\nanswering    the questions referred to        this   Bench\nwhereas some senior counsel also made attempts to\nattack the legality and correctness of Aadhar Scheme\nin their submissions.\n40)   These submissions, in my view, cannot be\nentertained in this case. It is for the reason that firstly,\nthis Bench is constituted to answer only specific\nquestions; secondly, the       submissions pressed in\nservice are not referred to this Bench and lastly, it is a\n22\nsettled principle of law that the reference Court cannot\ntravel beyond the reference made and is confined to\nanswer only those questions that are referred. (See -\nNaresh Shridhar Mirajkar & Ors. vs. State of\nMaharashtra & Anr.\n(1966) 3 SCR 744 at page 753).\n41)    Suffice it to say that as and when any of these\nquestions arise in any case, the appropriate Bench will\nexamine such questions on its merits in accordance\nwith law.\n42)    Before I part, I wish to place on record that it was\npleasure hearing the erudite arguments addressed by\nall the learned counsel. Every counsel argued with\nbrevity, lucidity and with remarkable clarity. The hard\nwork done by each counsel was phenomenal and\ndeserves to be complimented. Needless to say, but for\ntheir able assistance both in terms of oral argument as\nwell    as    written    briefs   (containing    thorough\n23\nsubmissions, variety of case law and the literature on\nthe subject), it was well nigh impossible to express the\nviews.\n………..................................J.\n[ABHAY MANOHAR SAPRE]\nNew Delhi,\nAugust 24, 2017.\n24\n1\nREPORTABLE\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION\nWRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 494 OF 2012\nJUSTICE K.S.

The\nconclusion is the same, answering the reference that privacy is not just a\ncommon law right, but a fundamental right falling in Part III of the\n3\nConstitution of India. I agree with this conclusion as privacy is a primal,\nnatural right which is inherent to an individual. However, I am tempted\nto set out my perspective on the issue of privacy as a right, which to my\nmind, is an important core of any individual existence.\n2.     A human being, from an individual existence, evolved into a\nsocial animal. Society thus envisaged a collective living beyond the\nindividual as a unit to what came to be known as the family. This, in\nturn, imposed duties and obligations towards the society. The right to\n“do as you please” became circumscribed by norms commonly\nacceptable to the larger social group. In time, the acceptable norms\nevolved into formal legal principles.\n3.     “The right to be”, though not extinguished for an individual, as\nthe society evolved, became hedged in by the complexity of the norms.\nThere has been a growing concern of the impact of technology which\nbreaches this “right to be”, or privacy – by whatever name we may call\nit.\n4.     The importance of privacy may vary from person to person\ndependent on his/her approach to society and his concern for being left\n4\nalone or not. That some people do not attach importance to their\nprivacy cannot be the basis for denying recognition to the right to\nprivacy as a basic human right.\n5.     It is not India alone, but the world that recognises the right of\nprivacy as a basic human right. The Universal Declaration of Human\nRights to which India is a signatory, recognises privacy as an\ninternational human right.\n6.     The importance of this right to privacy cannot be diluted and the\nsignificance of this is that the legal conundrum was debated and is to be\nsettled in the present reference by a nine-Judges Constitution Bench.\n7.     This reference has arisen from the challenge to what is called the\n‘Aadhar Card Scheme’. On account of earlier judicial pronouncements,\nthere was a cleavage of opinions and to reconcile this divergence of\nviews, it became necessary for the reference to be made to a nine-\nJudges Bench.\n8.     It is nobody’s case that privacy is not a valuable right, but the\nmoot point is whether it is only a common law right or achieves the\nstatus of a fundamental right under the Grundnorm – the Indian\n5\nConstitution. We have been ably assisted by various senior counsels\nboth for and against the proposition as to whether privacy is a\nConstitutional right or not.\nPRIVACY\n9.        In the words of Lord Action:\n“the sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for\namong old parchments of musty records. They are written,\nas with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature,\nby the hand of Divinity itself, and can never be obscured by\nmortal power1.”\n10.       Privacy is an inherent right. It is thus not given, but already exists.\nIt is about respecting an individual and it is undesirable to ignore a\nperson’s wishes without a compelling reason to do so.\n11.       The right to privacy may have different aspects starting from ‘the\nright to be let alone’ in the famous article by Samuel Warren and Louis\nD. Brandeis 2 . One such aspect is an individual’s right to control\ndissemination of his personal information. There is nothing wrong in\nindividuals limiting access and their ability to shield from unwanted\naccess. This aspect of the right to privacy has assumed particular\n1\nThe History of Freedom and Other Essays (1907), p 587\n2\nThe Right to Privacy 4 HLR 193\n6\nsignificance in this information age and in view of technological\nimprovements. A person-hood would be a protection of one’s\npersonality, individuality and dignity.3 However, no right is unbridled\nand so is it with privacy. We live in a society/ community. Hence,\nrestrictions arise from the interests of the community, state and from\nthose of others. Thus, it would be subject to certain restrictions which I\nwill revert to later.\nPRIVACY & TECHNOLOGY\n12.       We are in an information age.                          With the growth and\ndevelopment of technology, more information is now easily available.\nThe information explosion has manifold advantages but also some\ndisadvantages. The access to information, which an individual may not\nwant to give, needs the protection of privacy.\nThe right to privacy is claimed qua the State and non-State actors.\nRecognition and enforcement of claims qua non-state actors may\nrequire legislative intervention by the State.\n3\nDaniel Solove, ’10 Reasons Why Privacy Matters’ published on January 20, 2014\nhttps://www.teachprivacy.com/10-reasons-privacy-matters/\n7\nA. Privacy Concerns Against The State\n13.       The growth and development of technology has created new\ninstruments for the possible invasion of privacy by the State, including\nthrough surveillance, profiling and data collection and processing.\nSurveillance is not new, but technology has permitted surveillance in\nways that are unimaginable. Edward Snowden shocked the world with\nhis disclosures about global surveillance. States are utilizing technology\nin the most imaginative ways particularly in view of increasing global\nterrorist attacks and heightened public safety concerns. One such\ntechnique being adopted by States is ‘profiling’. The European Union\nRegulation of 20164 on data privacy defines ‘Profiling’ as any form of\nautomated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal\ndata to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in\nparticular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's\nperformance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,\n4\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of\nnatural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and\nrepealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\n8\ninterests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements5. Such profiling\ncan result in discrimination based on religion, ethnicity and caste.\nHowever, ‘profiling’ can also be used to further public interest and for\nthe benefit of national security.\n14.       The security environment, not only in our country, but\nthroughout the world makes the safety of persons and the State a\nmatter to be balanced against this right to privacy.\nB. Privacy Concerns Against Non-State Actors\n15.       The capacity of non-State actors to invade the home and privacy\nhas also been enhanced. Technological development has facilitated\njournalism that is more intrusive than ever before.\n16.       Further, in this digital age, individuals are constantly generating\nvaluable data which can be used by non-State actors to track their\nmoves, choices and preferences. Data is generated not just by active\nsharing of information, but also passively, with every click on the ‘world\n5\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of\nnatural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and\nrepealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\n9\nwide web’. We are stated to be creating an equal amount of information\nevery other day, as humanity created from the beginning of recorded\nhistory to the year 2003 – enabled by the ‘world wide web’.6\n17.       Recently, it was pointed out that “‘Uber’, the world’s largest taxi\ncompany, owns no vehicles. ‘Facebook’, the world’s most popular media\nowner, creates no content. ‘Alibaba’, the most valuable retailer, has no\ninventory. And ‘Airbnb’, the world’s largest accommodation provider,\nowns no real estate. Something interesting is happening.”7 ‘Uber’ knows\nour whereabouts and the places we frequent. ‘Facebook’ at the least,\nknows who we are friends with. ‘Alibaba’ knows our shopping habits.\n‘Airbnb’ knows where we are travelling to. Social networks providers,\nsearch engines, e-mail service providers, messaging applications are all\nfurther examples of non-state actors that have extensive knowledge of\nour movements, financial transactions, conversations – both personal\nand professional, health, mental state, interest, travel locations, fares\nand shopping habits. As we move towards becoming a digital economy\n6\nMichael L. Rustad, SannaKulevska, Reconceptualizing the right to be forgotten to enable transatlantic data flow,\n28 Harv.

These digital footprints and extensive data can be analyzed\ncomputationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially\nrelating to human behavior and interactions and hence, is valuable\ninformation. This is the age of ‘big data’. The advancement in technology\nhas created not just new forms of data, but also new methods of\nanalysing the data and has led to the discovery of new uses for data. The\nalgorithms are more effective and the computational power has\nmagnified exponentially. A large number of people would like to keep\nsuch search history private, but it rarely remains private, and is collected,\nsold and analysed for purposes such as targeted advertising. Of course,\n‘big data’ can also be used to further public interest. There may be cases\nwhere collection and processing of big data is legitimate and\nproportionate, despite being invasive of privacy otherwise.\n19.    Knowledge about a person gives a power over that person. The\npersonal data collected is capable of effecting representations,\ninfluencing decision making processes and shaping behaviour. It can be\n11\nused as a tool to exercise control over us like the ‘big brother’ State\nexercised. This can have a stultifying effect on the expression of dissent\nand difference of opinion, which no democracy can afford.\n20.       Thus, there is an unprecedented need for regulation regarding\nthe extent to which such information can be stored, processed and used\nby non-state actors. There is also a need for protection of such\ninformation from the State. Our Government was successful in\ncompelling Blackberry to give to it the ability to intercept data sent over\nBlackberry devices. While such interception may be desirable and\npermissible in order to ensure national security, it cannot be\nunregulated.8\n21.       The concept of ‘invasion of privacy’ is not the early conventional\nthought process of ‘poking ones nose in another person’s affairs’. It is\nnot so simplistic. In today’s world, privacy is a limit on the government’s\npower as well as the power of private sector entities.9\n8\nKadhim Shubber, Blackberry gives Indian Government ability to intercept messages published by Wired on 11 July,\n2013 http://www.wired.co.uk/article/blackberry-india\n9\nDaniel Solove, ’10 Reasons Why Privacy Matters’ published on January 20, 2014\nhttps://www.teachprivacy.com/10-reasons-privacy-matters/\n12\n22.     George Orwell created a fictional State in ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four.’\nToday, it can be a reality. The technological development today can\nenable not only the state, but also big corporations and private entities\nto be the ‘big brother’.\nThe Constitution of India - A Living Document\n23.     The   Constitutional jurisprudence of       all democracies in the\nworld, in some way or the other, refer to ‘the brooding spirit of the law’,\n‘the collective conscience’, ‘the intelligence of a future day’, ‘the heaven\nof freedom’ , etc. The spirit is justice for all, being the cherished value.\n24.     This spirit displays many qualities, and has myriad ways of\nexpressing herself – at times she was liberty, at times dignity. She was\nequality, she was fraternity, reasonableness and fairness. She was in\nAthens during the formative years of the demoscratos and she\nmanifested herself in England as the Magna Carta. Her presence was felt\nin France during the Revolution, in America when it was being founded\nand in South Africa during the times of Mandela.\n13\n25.       In our country, she inspired our founding fathers – The Sovereign,\nSocialist, Secular Democratic Republic of India was founded on her very\nspirit.\n26.       During the times of the Constituent Assembly, the great\nintellectuals of the day sought to give this brooding spirit a form, and\nsought to invoke her in a manner that they felt could be understood,\napplied and interpreted – they drafted the Indian Constitution.\n27.       In it they poured her essence, and gave to her a grand throne in\nPart III of the Indian Constitution.\n28.       The document that they created had her everlasting blessings,\nevery part of the Constitution resonates with the spirit of Justice and what\nit stands for: ‘peaceful, harmonious and orderly social living’. The\nConstitution stands as a codified representation of the great spirit of\nJustice itself. It is because it represents that Supreme Goodness that it has\nbeen conferred the status of the Grundnorm, that it is the Supreme Legal\nDocument in the country.\n29.       The Constitution was not drafted for a specific time period or for a\ncertain generation, it was drafted to stand firm, for eternity. It sought to\n14\ncreate a Montesquian framework that would endear in both war time and\nin peace time and in Ambedkar’s famous words, “if things go wrong under\nthe new Constitution the reason will not be that we had a bad\nConstitution. What we will have to say is that Man was vile.”10\n30.     It has already outlived its makers, and will continue to outlive our\ngeneration, because it contains within its core, a set of undefinable values\nand ideals that are eternal in nature. It is because it houses these values\nso cherished by mankind that it lives for eternity, as a Divine Chiranjeevi.\n31.     The Constitution, importantly, was also drafted for the purpose of\nassisting and at all times supporting this ‘peaceful, harmonious and\norderly social living’. The Constitution thus lives for the people. Its deepest\nwishes are that civil society flourishes and there is a peaceful social order.\nAny change in the sentiments of the people are recognised by it. It seeks\nto incorporate within its fold all possible civil rights which existed in the\npast, and those rights which may appear on the horizon of the future. It\nendears. The Constitution was never intended to serve as a means to stifle\nthe protection of the valuable rights of its citizens. Its aim and purpose\nwas completely the opposite.\n10\nDhananjay Keer, Dr.Ambedkar: Life and Mission, Bombay: Popular Prakashan, 1971 [1954], p.410.)\n15\n32.     The founders of the Constitution, were aware of the fact that the\nConstitution would need alteration to keep up with the mores and trends\nof the age. This was precisely the reason that an unrestricted amending\npower was sought to be incorporated in the text of the Constitution in\nPart 20 under\nArticle 368.\nThe very incorporation of such a plenary power\nin a separate part altogether is prima facie proof that the Constitution,\neven during the times of its making was intended to be a timeless\ndocument, eternal in nature, organic and living.\n33.     Therefore, the theory of original intent itself supports the stand that\nthe original intention of the makers of the Constitutional was to ensure\nthat     it   does   not    get    weighed     down     by    the   originalist\ninterpretations/remain static/fossilised, but changes and evolves to suit\nthe felt need of the times. The original intention theory itself\ncontemplates a Constitution which is organic in nature.\n34.     The then Chief Justice of India, Patanjali Sastri, in the\nState of West\nBengal vs. Anwar Ali Sarkar11\nobserved as follows:\n“90. I find it impossible to read these portions of the\nConstitution without regard to the background out of which\n11\nAIR 1952 SCR 284\n16\nthey arose. I cannot blot out their history and omit from\nconsideration the brooding spirit of the times. They are not\njust dull, lifeless words static and hide-bound as in some\nmummified manuscript, but, living flames intended to give\nlife to a great nation and order its being, tongues of\ndynamic fire, potent to mould the future as well as guide\nthe present. The Constitution must, in my judgment, be left\nelastic enough to meet from time to time the altering\nconditions of a changing world with its shifting emphasis\nand differing needs.”\n35.     How the Constitution should be read and interpreted is best found\nin the words of Khanna,J., in\nKesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala12\nas\nfollows:\n“1437. …. A Constitution is essentially different from\npleadings filed in Court of litigating parties. Pleadings\ncontain claim and counter-claim of private parties engaged\nin litigation, while a Constitution provides for the\nframework of the different organs of the State viz. the\nexecutive, the legislature and the judiciary. A Constitution\nalso reflects the hopes and aspirations of a people. Besides\nlaying down the norms for the functioning of different\norgans a Constitution encompasses within itself the broad\nindications as to how the nation is to march forward in\ntimes to come. A Constitution cannot be regarded as a\nmere legal document to be read as a will or an agreement\nnor is Constitution like a plaint or written statement filed in\na suit between two litigants. A Constitution must of\nnecessity be the vehicle of the life of a nation. It has also to\nbe borne in mind that a Constitution is not a gate but a\n12\n(1973) 4 SCC 225\n17\nroad. Beneath the drafting of a Constitution is the\nawareness that things do not stand still but move on, that\nlife of a progressive nation, as of an individual, is not static\nand stagnant but dynamic and dashful. A Constitution must\ntherefore contain ample provision for experiment and trial\nin the task of administration.\nA Constitution, it needs to be emphasised, is not a\ndocument for fastidious dialectics but the means of\nordering the life of a people. It had (sic) its roots in the\npast, its continuity is reflected in the present and it is\nintended for the unknown future. The words of Holmes\nwhile dealing with the U.S. Constitution have equal\nrelevance for our Constitution. Said the great Judge:\n“… the provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical\nformulas having their essence in their form; they are\norganic living institutions transplanted from English soil.\nTheir significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not\nsimply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by\nconsidering their origin and the line of their growth.”\n[See Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610 (1914)].\nIt is necessary to keep in view Marshall's great premises\nthat “It is a Constitution we are expounding”. To quote the\nwords of Felix Frankfurter in his tribute to Holmes:\n“Whether the Constitution is treated primarily as a text for\ninterpretation or as an instrument of Government may\nmake all the difference in the word. The fate of cases, and\nthereby of legislation, will turn on whether the meaning of\nthe document is derived from itself or from one's\nconception of the country, its development, its needs, its\nplace in a civilized society.” (See Mr Justice Holmes edited\nby Felix Frankfurter, p. 58). (Emphasis supplied)\n18\n36.      In the same judgment, K.K. Mathew, J., observed :\n1563 ... That the Constitution is a framework of great\ngovernmental powers to be exercised for great public ends\nin the future, is not a pale intellectual concept but a\ndynamic idea which must dominate in any consideration of\nthe width of the amending power. No existing Constitution\nhas reached its final form and shape and become, as it\nwere a fixed thing incapable of further growth. Human\nsocieties keep changing; needs emerge, first vaguely felt\nand unexpressed, imperceptibly gathering strength,\nsteadily becoming more and more exigent, generating a\nforce which, if left unheeded and denied response so as to\nsatisfy the impulse behind it, may burst forthwith an\nintensity that exacts more than reasonable satisfaction.\n[See Felix Frankfurter, of Law and Men, p 35] As Wilson\nsaid, a living Constitution must be Darwinian in structure\nand practice. [See Constitutional Government in The\nUnited States, p 25] The Constitution of a nation is the\noutward and visible manifestation of the life of the people\nand it must respond to the deep pulsation for change\nwithin. “A Constitution is an experiment as all life is an\nexperiment.” [See Justice Holmes in Abrams v United\nStates, 250 US 616]…”\n37.\nIn the context of the necessity of the doctrine of flexibility while\ndealing with the Constitution, it was observed in\nUnion of India vs. Naveen\nJindal13\n:\n“39. Constitution being a living organ, its ongoing\ninterpretation is permissible. The supremacy of the\nConstitution is essential to bring social changes in the\nnational polity evolved with the passage of time.\n13\n(2004) 2 SCC 510\n19\n40. Interpretation of the Constitution is a difficult task.\nWhile doing so, the Constitutional courts are not only\nrequired to take into consideration their own experience\nover the time, the international treaties and covenants but\nalso keeping the doctrine of flexibility in mind. This Court\ntimes without number has extended the scope and extent\nof the provisions of the fundamental rights, having regard\nto several factors including the intent and purport of the\nConstitution-makers as reflected in Parts IV and IV-A of the\nConstitution of India.”\n38.    The document itself, though inked in a parched paper of timeless\nvalue, never grows old. Its ideals and values forever stay young and\nenergetic, forever changing with the times. It represents the pulse and\nsoul of the nation and like a phoenix, grows and evolves, but at the same\ntime remains young and malleable.\n39.   The notions of goodness, fairness, equality and dignity can never\nbe satisfactorily defined, they can only be experienced. They are felt.\nThey were let abstract for the reason that these rights, by their very\nnature, are not static. They can never be certainly defined or applied, for\nthey change not only with time, but also with situations. The same\nconcept can be differently understood, applied and interpreted and\ntherein lies their beauty and their importance. This multiplicity of\ninterpretation and application is the very core which allows them to be\n20\ndifferently understood and applied in changing social and cultural\nsituations.\n40.     Therefore, these core values, these core principles, are all various\nfacets of the spirit that pervades our Constitution and they apply and\nread differently in various scenarios. They manifest themselves differently\nin different ages, situations and conditions. Though being rooted in\nancient Constitutional principles, they find mention and applicability as\ndifferent rights and social privileges. They appear differently, based on\nthe factual circumstance. Privacy, for example is nothing but a form of\ndignity, which itself is a subset of liberty.\n41.     Thus, from the one great tree, there are branches, and from\nthese branches there are sub-branches and leaves. Every one of these\nleaves are rights, all tracing back to the tree of justice. They are all\nequally important and of equal need in the great social order. They\ntogether form part of that ‘great brooding spirit’. Denial of one of them\nis the denial of the whole, for these rights, in manner of speaking,\nfertilise and nurture each other.\n21\n42. What is beautiful in this biological, organic growth is this: While the\ntree appears to be great and magnificent, apparently incapable of further\ngrowth, there are always new branches appearing, new leaves and buds\ngrowing. These new rights, are the rights of future generations that\nevolve over the passage of time to suit and facilitate the civility of\nposterity. They are equally part of this tree of rights and equally trace\ntheir origins to those natural rights which we are all born with. These\nleaves, sprout and grow with the passage of time, just as certain rights\nmay get weeded out due to natural evolution.\n43.    At this juncture of time, we are incapable and it is nigh impossible\nto anticipate and foresee what these new buds may be. There can be no\ncertainty in making this prediction. However, what remains certain is that\nthere will indeed be a continual growth of the great tree that we call the\nConstitution. This beautiful aspect of the document is what makes it\norganic, dynamic, young and everlasting. And it is important that the tree\ngrows further, for the Republic finds a shade under its branches.\n44.   The challenges to protect privacy have increased manifold. The\nobservations made in the context of the need for law to change, by\n22\nBhagwati, J., as he then was, in\nNational Textile Workers Union Vs. P.R.\n14\nRamakrishnan\nwould equally apply to          the    requirements    of\ninterpretation of the Constitution in the present context:\n“We cannot allow the dead hand of the past to stifle the\ngrowth of the living present. Law cannot stand still; it must\nchange with the changing social concepts and values. If the\nbark that protects the tree fails to grow and expand along\nwith the tree, it will either choke the tree or if it is a living\ntree, it will shed that bark and grow a new living bark for\nitself. Similarly, if the law fails to respond to the needs of\nchanging society, then either it will stifle the growth of the\nsociety and choke its progress or if the society is vigorous\nenough, it will cast away the law which stands in the way of\nits growth. Law must therefore constantly be on the move\nadapting itself to the fast-changing society and not lag\nbehind.”\n45.     It is wrong to consider that the concept of the supervening spirit of\njustice manifesting in different forms to cure the evils of a new age is\nunknown to Indian history. Lord Shri Krishna declared in Chapter 4 Text 8 of\nThe Bhagavad Gita thus:\n“प\u0003र\u0005ाणायसाधूनां             \u000fवनाशायचद\u0015ु कृताम ्।\nधम\nसं\nथापनाथा\nय स\u001fभवा!म युगे युगे ||”\n14\n(1983) 1 SCC 228\n23\n46.   The meaning of this profound statement, when viewed after a\nthousand generations is this: That each age and each generation brings with\nit the challenges and tribulations of the times. But that Supreme spirit of\nJustice manifests itself in different eras, in different continents and in\ndifferent social situations, as different values to ensure that there always\nexists the protection and preservation of certain eternally cherished rights\nand ideals. It is a reflection of this divine ‘Brooding spirit of the law’, ‘the\ncollective conscience’, ‘the intelligence of a future day’ that has found\nmention in the ideals enshrined in inter- alia,\nArticle 14\nand\n21\n, which\ntogether serve as the heart stones of the Constitution. The spirit that finds\nenshrinement in these articles manifests and reincarnates itself in ways\nand forms that protect the needs of the society in various ages, as the\nvalues of liberty, equality, fraternity, dignity, and various other\nConstitutional values, Constitutional principles. It always grows stronger\nand covers within its sweep the great needs of the times. This spirit can\nneither remain dormant nor static and can never be allowed to fossilise.\n47.   An issue like privacy could never have been anticipated to acquire\nsuch a level of importance when the Constitution was being contemplated.\n24\nYet, today, the times we live in necessitate that it be recognised not only as\na valuable right, but as a right Fundamental in Constitutional jurisprudence.\n48.   There are sure to be times in the future, similar to our experience\ntoday, perhaps as close as 10 years from today or as far off as a 100 years,\nwhen we will debate and deliberate whether a certain right is fundamental\nor not. At that time it must be understood that the Constitution was always\nmeant to be an accommodative and all-encompassing document, framed to\ncover in its fold all those rights that are most deeply cherished and required\nfor a ‘peaceful, harmonious and orderly social living.\n49.   The Constitution and its all-encompassing spirit forever grows, but\nnever ages.\nPrivacy is essential to liberty and dignity\n50.   Rohinton F. Nariman, J., and Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud J., have\nemphasized the importance of the protection of privacy to ensure\nprotection of liberty and dignity. I agree with them and seek to refer to\nsome legal observations in this regard:\n25\nIn Robertson and Nicol on Media Law15 it was observed:\n“Individuals have a psychological need to preserve an\nintrusion-free zone for their personality and family and\nsuffer anguish and stress when that zone is violated.\nDemocratic societies must protect privacy as part of their\nfacilitation of individual freedom, and offer some legal\nsupport for the individual choice as to what aspects of\nintimate personal life the citizen is prepared to share with\nothers. This freedom in other words springs from the same\nsource as freedom of expression: a liberty that enhances\nindividual life in a democratic community.”\n51.       Lord Nicholls and Lord Hoffmann in their opinion in Naomi\nCampbell’s case16 recognized the importance of the protection of privacy.\nLord Hoffman opined as under:\n“50. What human rights law has done is to identify private\ninformation as something worth protecting as an aspect of\nhuman autonomy and dignity. And this recognition has\nraised inescapably the question of why it should be worth\nprotecting against the state but not against a private\nperson. There may of course be justifications for the\npublication of private information by private persons which\nwould not be available to the state - I have particularly in\nmind the position of the media, to which I shall return in a\nmoment - but I can see no logical ground for saying that a\nperson should have less protection against a private\nindividual than he would have against the state for the\n15\nGeoffrey Robertson, QC and Andrew Nicol, QC, Media Law fifth edition p. 265\n16\nCampbell V. MGN Ltd.2004 UKHL 22\n26\npublication of personal information for which there is no\njustification. Nor, it appears, have any of the other judges\nwho have considered the matter.\n51. The result of these developments has been a shift in the\ncentre of gravity of the action for breach of confidence\nwhen it is used as a remedy for the unjustified publication of\npersonal information. …. Instead of the cause of action\nbeing based upon the duty of good faith applicable to\nconfidential personal information and trade secrets alike, it\nfocuses upon the protection of human autonomy and\ndignity - the right to control the dissemination of\ninformation about one's private life and the right to the\nesteem and respect of other people.”\nLord Nicholls opined as under:\n“12. The present case concerns one aspect of invasion of\nprivacy: wrongful disclosure of private information. The\ncase involves the familiar competition between freedom of\nexpression and respect for an individual's privacy. Both are\nvitally important rights. Neither has precedence over the\nother. The importance of freedom of expression has been\nstressed often and eloquently, the importance of privacy\nless so. But it, too, lies at the heart of liberty in a modern\nstate. A proper degree of privacy is essential for the well-\nbeing and development of an individual. And restraints\nimposed on government to pry into the lives of the citizen\ngo to the essence of a democratic state: see La Forest J in R\nv Dymont [1988] 2 SCR 417, 426.”\n52. Privacy is also the key to freedom of thought. A person has a right to\nthink. The thoughts are sometimes translated into speech but confined to\nthe person to whom it is made. For example, one may want to criticize\nsomeone but not share the criticism with the world.\n27\nPrivacy – Right To Control Information\n53.    I had earlier adverted to an aspect of privacy – the right to\ncontrol dissemination of personal information. The boundaries that\npeople establish from others in society are not only physical but also\ninformational. There are different kinds of boundaries in respect to\ndifferent relations.   Privacy assists in preventing awkward social\nsituations and reducing social frictions. Most of the information about\nindividuals can fall under the phrase “none of your business”. On\ninformation being shared voluntarily, the same may be said to be in\nconfidence and any breach of confidentiality is a breach of the trust.\nThis is more so in the professional relationships such as with doctors and\nlawyers which requires an element of candor in disclosure of\ninformation. An individual has the right to control one’s life while\nsubmitting personal data for various facilities and services. It is but\nessential that the individual knows as to what the data is being used for\nwith the ability to correct and amend it. The hallmark of freedom in a\ndemocracy is having the autonomy and control over our lives which\n28\nbecomes impossible, if important decisions are made in secret without\nour awareness or participation.17\n54.       Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J., notes that recognizing a zone of privacy\nis but an acknowledgement that each individual must be entitled to\nchart and pursue the course of development of their personality.\nRohinton F. Nariman,J., recognizes informational privacy which\nrecognizes that an individual may have control over the dissemination of\nmaterial which is personal to him. Recognized thus, from the right to\nprivacy in this modern age emanate certain other rights such as the right\nof individuals to exclusively commercially exploit their identity and\npersonal information, to control the information that is available about\nthem on the ‘world wide web’ and to disseminate certain personal\ninformation for limited purposes alone.\n55.       Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis in 1890 expressed the belief\nthat an individual should control the degree and type of private –\npersonal information that is made public :\n17\nDaniel Solove, ’10 Reasons Why Privacy Matters’ published on January 20, 2014\nhttps://www.teachprivacy.com/10-reasons-privacy-matters/\n29\n“The common law secures to each individual the right of\ndetermining, ordinarily, to what extent his thoughts,\nsentiments, and emotions shall be communicated to\nothers.... It is immaterial whether it be by word or by signs,\nin painting, by sculpture, or in music.... In every such case\nthe individual is entitled to decide whether that which is his\nshall be given to the public.”\nThis formulation of the right to privacy has particular relevance in\ntoday’s information and digital age.\n56.       An individual has a right to protect his reputation from being\nunfairly harmed and such protection of reputation needs to exist not\nonly against falsehood but also certain truths. It cannot be said that a\nmore accurate judgment about people can be facilitated by knowing\nprivate details about their lives – people judge us badly, they judge us in\nhaste, they judge out of context, they judge without hearing the whole\nstory and they judge with hypocrisy.                       Privacy lets people protect\nthemselves from these troublesome judgments18.\n57.       There is no justification for making all truthful information\navailable to the public. The public does not have an interest in knowing\n18\nDaniel Solove, ’10 Reasons Why Privacy Matters’ published on January 20, 2014\nhttps://www.teachprivacy.com/10-reasons-privacy-matters/\n30\nall information that is true. Which celebrity has had sexual relationships\nwith whom might be of interest to the public but has no element of\npublic interest and may therefore be a breach of privacy.19 Thus, truthful\ninformation that breaches privacy may also require protection.\n58.       Every individual should have a right to be able to exercise control\nover his/her own life and image as portrayed to the world and to control\ncommercial use of his/her identity. This also means that an individual\nmay be permitted to prevent others from using his image, name and\nother aspects of his/her personal life and identity for commercial\npurposes without his/her consent.20\n59. Aside from the economic justifications for such a right, it is also\njustified as protecting individual autonomy and personal dignity. The\nright protects an individual’s free, personal conception of the ‘self.’ The\nright of publicity implicates a person’s interest in autonomous self-\n19\nThe UK Courts granted in super-injunctions to protect privacy of certain celebrities by tabloids which meant that\nnot only could the private information not be published but the very fact of existence of that case & injunction\ncould also not be published.\n20\nThe Second Circuit’s decision in Haelan Laboratories v. Topps Chewing Gum. 202 F.2d 866 (2d Cir. 1953) penned\nby Judge Jerome Frank defined the right to publicity as “the right to grant the exclusive privilege of publishing his\npicture”.\n31\ndefinition, which prevents others from interfering with the meanings\nand values that the public associates with her.21\n60. Prosser categorized the invasion of privacy into four separate torts22:\n1) Unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of another;\n2) Appropriation of another’s name or likeness;\n3) Unreasonable publicity given to the other’s private life; and\n4) Publicity that unreasonably places the other in a false light before\nthe public\nFrom the second tort, the U.S. has adopted a right to publicity.23\n61.       In the poetic words of Felicia Lamport mentioned in the book\n“The Assault on Privacy24” :\n“DEPRIVACY\nAlthough we feel unknown, ignored\nAs unrecorded blanks,\nTake heart! Our vital selves are stored\nIn giant data banks,\nOur childhoods and maturities,\nEfficiently compiled,\nOur Stocks and insecurities,\nAll permanently filed,\n21\nMark P.

The right of an individual to exercise control over his personal\ndata and to be able to control his/her own life would also encompass\nhis right to control his existence on the internet. Needless to say that\nthis would not be an absolute right.The existence of such a right does\nnot imply that a criminal can obliterate his past, but that there are\nvariant degrees of mistakes, small and big, and it cannot be said that a\nperson should be profiled to the nth extent for all and sundry to know.\n63.   A high school teacher was fired after posting on her Facebook\npage that she was “so not looking forward to another [school] year”\nsince that the school district’s residents were “arrogant and snobby”. A\nflight attended was fired for posting suggestive photos of herself in the\n33\ncompany’s uniform.25 In the pre-digital era, such incidents would have\nnever occurred. People could then make mistakes and embarrass\nthemselves, with the comfort that the information will be typically\nforgotten over time.\n64. The impact of the digital age results in information on the internet\nbeing permanent. Humans forget, but the internet does not forget and\ndoes not let humans forget. Any endeavour to remove information\nfrom the internet does not result in its absolute obliteration. The foot\nprints remain. It is thus, said that in the digital world preservation is\nthe norm and forgetting a struggle26.\n65. The technology results almost in a sort of a permanent storage in\nsome way or the other making it difficult to begin life again giving up\npast mistakes. People are not static, they change and grow through\ntheir lives. They evolve. They make mistakes. But they are entitled to\nre-invent themselves and reform and correct their mistakes. It is\n25\nPatricia Sánchez Abril, Blurred Boundaries: Social Media Privacy and the Twenty-First-Century Employee, 49 AM.\nBUS.

Children around the world create perpetual digital footprints on\nsocial network websites on a 24/7 basis as they learn their ‘ABCs’:\nApple, Bluetooth, and Chat followed by Download, E-Mail, Facebook,\nGoogle, Hotmail, and Instagram.27 They should not be subjected to the\nconsequences of their childish mistakes and naivety, their entire life.\nPrivacy of children will require special protection not just in the context\nof the virtual world, but also the real world.\n67. People change and an individual should be able to determine the\npath of his life and not be stuck only on a path of which he/she treaded\ninitially. An individual should have the capacity to change his/her\nbeliefs and evolve as a person. Individuals should not live in fear that\nthe views they expressed will forever be associated with them and thus\nrefrain from expressing themselves.\n27\nMichael L. Rustad, Sanna Kulevska, Reconceptualizing the right to be forgotten to enable transatlantic data flow,\n28 Harv. J.L. & Tech. 349\n35\n68. Whereas this right to control dissemination of personal\ninformation in the physical and virtual space should not amount to a\nright of total eraser of history, this right, as a part of the larger right of\nprivacy, has to be balanced against other fundamental rights like the\nfreedom of expression, or freedom of media, fundamental to a\ndemocratic society.\n69. Thus, The European Union Regulation of 201628 has recognized\nwhat has been termed as ‘the right to be forgotten’. This does not\nmean that all aspects of earlier existence are to be obliterated, as some\nmay have a social ramification. If we were to recognize a similar right, it\nwould only mean that an individual who is no longer desirous of his\npersonal data to be processed or stored, should be able to remove it\nfrom the system where the personal data/ information is no longer\nnecessary, relevant, or is incorrect and serves no legitimate interest.\nSuch a right cannot be exercised where the information/ data is\nnecessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and\ninformation, for compliance with              legal obligations, for the\n28\nSupra\n36\nperformance of a task carried out in public interest, on the grounds of\npublic interest in the area of public health, for archiving purposes in\nthe public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or\nstatistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of\nlegal claims. Such justifications would be valid in all cases of breach of\nprivacy, including breaches of data privacy.\nData Regulation\n70. I agree with Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J., that formulation of data\nprotection is a complex exercise which needs to be undertaken by the\nState after a careful balancing of privacy concerns and legitimate State\ninterests, including public benefit arising from scientific and historical\nresearch based on data collected and processed. The European Union\nRegulation of 201629 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the\nprocessing of personal data and on the free movement of such data\nmay provide useful guidance in this regard. The State must ensure that\n29\nSupra\n37\ninformation is not used without the consent of users and that it is used\nfor the purpose and to the extent it was disclosed. Thus, for e.g. , if the\nposting on social media websites is meant only for a certain audience,\nwhich is possible as per tools available, then it cannot be said that all\nand sundry in public have a right to somehow access that information\nand make use of it.\nTest: Principle of Proportionality and Legitimacy\n71. The concerns expressed on behalf of the petitioners arising from\nthe possibility of the State infringing the right to privacy can be met by\nthe test suggested for limiting the discretion of the State:\n“ (i) The action must be sanctioned by law;\n(ii) The proposed action must be necessary in a democratic\nsociety for a legitimate aim;\n(iii) The extent of such interference must be proportionate to\nthe need for such interference;\n(iv) There must be procedural guarantees against abuse of such\ninterference.”\nThe Restrictions\n38\n72.    The right to privacy as already observed is not absolute. The right\nto privacy as falling in part III of the Constitution may, depending on its\nvariable facts, vest in one part or the other, and would thus be subject\nto the restrictions of exercise of that particular fundamental right.\nNational security would thus be an obvious restriction, so would the\nprovisos to different fundamental rights, dependent on where the right\nto privacy would arise. The Public interest element would be another\naspect.\n73.    It would be useful to turn to The European Union Regulation of\n201630 . Restrictions of the right to privacy may be justifiable in the\nfollowing circumstances subject to the principle of proportionality:\n(a) Other fundamental rights: The right to privacy must be\nconsidered in relation to its function in society and be\nbalanced against other fundamental rights.\n(b) Legitimate national security interest\n(c) Public interest including scientific or historical research\npurposes or statistical purposes\n30\nSupra\n39\n(d) Criminal Offences: the need of the competent authorities\nfor prevention investigation, prosecution of criminal\noffences including safeguards against threat to public\nsecurity;\n(e) The unidentifiable data: the information does not relate to\nidentifiedor identifiable natural person but remains\nanonymous. The European Union Regulation of\n2016 31 refers to ‘pseudonymisation’ which means the\nprocessing of personal data in such a manner that the\npersonal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data\nsubject without the use of additional information,\nprovided that such additional information is kept\nseparately and is subject to technical and organisational\nmeasures to ensure that the personal data are not\nattributed to an identified or identifiable natural person;\n(f) The tax etc: the regulatory framework of tax and working\nof financial institutions, markets may require disclosure of\nprivate information. But then this would not entitle the\ndisclosure of the information to all and sundry and there\nshould be data protection rules according to the objectives\nof the processing. There may however, be processing\nwhich is compatible for the purposes for which it is initially\ncollected.\nReport of Group of Experts on Privacy\n74.    It is not as if the aspect of privacy has not met with concerns. The\nPlanning Commission of India constituted the Group of Experts on Privacy\n31\nSupra\n40\nunder the Chairmanship of Justice A.P. Shah, which submitted a report on\n16 October, 2012.       The five salient features, in his own words, are as\nfollows:\n“1. Technological Neutrality and Interoperability with\nInternational Standards: The Group agreed that any\nproposed framework for privacy legislation must be\ntechnologically neutral and interoperable with international\nstandards. Specifically the Privacy Act should not make any\nreference to specific technologies and must be generic\nenough such that the principles and enforcement\nmechanisms remain adaptable to changes in society, the\nmarketplace, technology, and the government. To do this it\nis important to closely harmonise the right to privacy with\nmultiple international regimes, create trust and facilitate co-\noperation between national and international stakeholders\nand provide equal and adequate levels of protection to data\nprocessed inside India as well as outside it. In doing so, the\nframework should recognise that data has economic value,\nand that global data flows generate value for the individual\nas data creator, and for businesses that collect and process\nsuch data. Thus, one of the focuses of the framework\nshould be on inspiring the trust of global clients and their\nend users, without compromising the interests of domestic\ncustomers in enhancing their privacy protection.\n2. Multi-Dimensional Privacy: This report recognises the\nright to privacy in its multiple dimensions. A framework on\nthe right to privacy in India must include privacy-related\nconcerns around data protection on the internet and\nchallenges emerging therefrom, appropriate protection\nfrom unauthorised interception, audio and video\nsurveillance, use of personal identifiers, bodily privacy\nincluding DNA as well as physical privacy, which are crucial\nin establishing a national ethos for privacy protection,\n41\nthough the specific forms such protection will take must\nremain flexible to address new and emerging concerns.\n3. Horizontal Applicability: The Group agreed that any\nproposed privacy legislation must apply both to the\ngovernment as well as to the private sector. Given that the\ninternational trend is towards a set of unified norms\ngoverning both the private and public sector, and both\nsectors process large amounts of data in India, it is\nimperative to bring both within the purview of the\nproposed legislation.\n4. Conformity with Privacy Principles: This report\nrecommends nine fundamental Privacy Principles to form\nthe bedrock of the proposed Privacy Act in India. These\nprinciples, drawn from best practices internationally, and\nadapted suitably to an Indian context, are intended to\nprovide the baseline level of privacy protection to all\nindividual data subjects. The fundamental philosophy\nunderlining the principles is the need to hold the data\ncontroller accountable for the collection, processing and\nuse to which the data is put thereby ensuring that the\nprivacy of the data subject is guaranteed.\n5.    Co-Regulatory Enforcement Regime: This report\nrecommends the establishment of the office of the Privacy\nCommissioner, both at the central and regional levels. The\nPrivacy Commissioners shall be the primary authority for\nenforcement of the provisions of the Act. However, rather\nthan prescribe a pure top-down approach to enforcement,\nthis report recommends a system of co-regulation, with\nequal emphasis on Self-Regulating Organisations (SROs)\nbeing vested with the responsibility of autonomously\nensuring compliance with the Act, subject to regular\noversight by the Privacy Commissioners. The SROs, apart\nfrom possessing industry-specific knowledge, will also be\nbetter placed to create awareness about the right to\nprivacy and explaining the sensitivities of privacy protection\nboth within industry as well as to the public in respective\n42\nsectors. This recommendation of a co-regulatory regime\nwill not derogate from the powers of courts which will be\navailable as a forum of last resort in case of persistent and\nunresolved violations of the Privacy Act.”\n75.   The enactment of a law on the subject is still awaited. This was\npreceded by the Privacy Bill of the year of 2005 but there appears to have\nbeen little progress. It was only in the course of the hearing that we were\npresented with an office memorandum of the Ministry of Electronics and\nInformation Technology dated 31.7.2017, through which a Committee of\nExperts had been constituted to deliberate on a data protection\nframework for India, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice B.N.\nSrikrishna, former Judge of the Supreme Court of India, in order to\nidentify key data protection issues in India and recommend methods of\naddressing them. So there is hope !\n76.   The aforesaid aspect has been referred to for purposes that the\nconcerns about privacy have been left unattended for quite some time\nand thus an infringement of the right of privacy cannot be left to be\nformulated by the legislature. It is a primal natural right which is only\nbeing recognized as a fundamental right falling in part III of the\nConstitution of India.\n43\nCONCLUSION\n77.   The right of privacy is a fundamental right. It is a right which\nprotects the inner sphere of the individual from interference from both\nState, and non-State actors and allows the individuals to make\nautonomous life choices.\n78.   It was rightly expressed on behalf of the petitioners that the\ntechnology has made it possible to enter a citizen’s house without\nknocking at his/her door and this is equally possible both by the State and\nnon-State actors. It is an individual’s choice as to who enters his house,\nhow he lives and in what relationship. The privacy of the home must\nprotect the family, marriage, procreation and sexual orientation which are\nall important aspects of dignity.\n79.   If the individual permits someone to enter the house it does not\nmean that others can enter the house.      The only check and balance is\nthat it should not harm the other individual or affect his or her rights.\nThis applies both to the physical form and to technology. In an era where\nthere are wide, varied, social and cultural norms and more so in a country\nlike ours which prides itself on its diversity, privacy is one of the most\n44\nimportant rights to be protected both against State and non-State actors\nand be recognized as a fundamental right. How it thereafter works out in\nits inter-play with other fundamental rights and when such restrictions\nwould become necessary would depend on the factual matrix of each\ncase. That it may give rise to more litigation can hardly be the reason not\nto recognize this important, natural, primordial right as a fundamental\nright.\n80.        There are two aspects of the opinion of Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud,J.,\none of which is common to the opinion of Rohinton F. Nariman,J.,\nneeding specific mention.           While considering the evolution of\nConstitutional jurisprudence on the right of privacy he has referred to the\njudgment in\nSuresh Kumar Koushal Vs. Naz Foundation.32 In\nthe challenge\nlaid to\nSection 377\nof the Indian Penal Code before the Delhi High Court,\none of the grounds of challenge was that the said provision amounted to\nan infringement of the right to dignity and privacy. The Delhi High Court,\ninter alia, observed that the right to live with dignity and the right of\nprivacy both are recognized as dimensions of\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution of India. The view of the High Court, however did not find\n32\n(2014) 1 SCC 1\n45\nfavour with the Supreme Court and it was observed that only a miniscule\nfraction of the country’s population constitutes lesbians, gays, bisexuals\nor transgenders and thus, there cannot be any basis for declaring the\nSection ultra virus of provisions of\nArticles 14\n, 15\nand\n21\nof the\nConstitution. The matter did not rest at this, as the issue of privacy and\ndignity discussed by the High Court was also observed upon. The sexual\norientation even within the four walls of the house thus became an\naspect of debate.     I am in agreement with the view of Dr. D.Y.\nChandrachud, J., who in paragraphs 123 & 124 of his judgment, states\nthat the right of privacy cannot be denied, even if there is a miniscule\nfraction of the population which is affected. The majoritarian concept\ndoes not apply to Constitutional rights and the Courts are often called up\non to take what may be categorized as a non-majoritarian view, in the\ncheck and balance of power envisaged under the Constitution of India.\nOnes sexual orientation is undoubtedly an attribute of privacy.\nThe\nobservations made in Mosley vs. News Group Papers Ltd. 33, in a broader\nconcept may be usefully referred to:\n33\n(2008) EWHS 1777 (QB)\n46\n“130… It is not simply a matter of personal privacy versus\nthe public interest. The modern perception is that there is a\npublic interest in respecting personal privacy. It is thus a\nquestion of taking account of conflicting public interest\nconsiderations and evaluating them according to\nincreasingly well recognized criteria.\n131.      When the courts identify an infringement of a\nperson’s\nArticle 8\nrights, and in particular in the context of\nhis freedom to conduct his sex life and personal\nrelationships as he wishes, it is right to afford a remedy and\nto vindicate that right. The only permitted exception is\nwhere there is a countervailing public interest which in the\nparticular circumstances is strong enough to outweigh it;\nthat is to say, because one at least of the established\n“limiting principles” comes into play. Was it necessary and\nproportionate for the intrusion to take place, for example,\nin order to expose illegal activity or to prevent the public\nfrom being significantly misled by public claims hitherto\nmade by the individual concerned (as with Naomi\nCampbell’s public denials of drug-taking)? Or was it\nnecessary because the information, in the words of the\nStrasbourg court in Von Hannover at (60) and (76), would\nmake a contribution to “a debate of general interest”? That\nis, of course, a very high test, it is yet to be determined how\nfar that doctrine will be taken in the courts of this\njurisdiction in relation to photography in public places. If\ntaken literally, it would mean a very significant change in\nwhat is permitted. It would have a profound effect on the\ntabloid and celebrity culture to which we have become\naccustomed in recent years.”\n81.   It is not necessary to delve into this issue further, other than in the\ncontext of privacy as that would be an issue to be debated before the\nappropriate Bench, the matter having been referred to a larger Bench.\n47\n82.     The second aspect is the discussion in respect of the majority\njudgment in the case of ADM Jabalpur vs. Shivkant Shukla34 in both the\nopinions.\nIn\nI.R. Coelho Vs. The State of Tamil Nadu35\nit was observed\nthat the ADM Jabalpur case has been impliedly overruled and that the\nsupervening event was the 44th Amendment to the Constitution,\namending\nArticle 359\nof the Constitution.\nI fully agree with the view\nexpressly overruling the ADM Jabalpur case which was an aberration in\nthe constitutional jurisprudence of our country and the desirability of\nburying the majority opinion ten fathom deep, with no chance of\nresurrection.\n83.     Let the right of privacy, an inherent right, be unequivocally a\nfundamental right embedded in part-III of the Constitution of India, but\nsubject to the restrictions specified, relatable to that part. This is the call\nof today. The old order changeth yielding place to new.\n……………………………………..J.\n(SANJAY KISHAN KAUL)\nNew Delhi\nAugust 24 , 2017.\n34\n(1976) 2 SCC 521\n35\n(2007) 2 SCC 1\nREPORTABLE\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION\nWRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO 494 OF 2012\nJUSTICE K.S.PUTTASWAMY (RETD.),\nAND ANR.                                     ..Petitioners\nVERSUS\nUNION OF INDIA AND ORS.                      ..Respondents\nWITH\nT.C.
