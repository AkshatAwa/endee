On the 4th\tof  July  1977,\t the\npetitioner received a letter dated 2nd July, 1977, from\t the\nRegional  Passport Officer Delhi intimating to her  that  it\nwas  decided  by  the Government of  India  to\timpound\t her\npassport under\ns. 10(3)(c)\nof the Act \"in public  interest\".\nThe petitioner was required to surrender her passport within\n7  days\t from the receipt of that  letter.   The  petitioner\nimmediately  addressed\ta letter to  the  Regional  Passport\nOfficer requesting him to furnish a copy of the statement of\nreasons for making the order as provided in\ns.10(5)\n. A reply\nwas  sent by the Government of India, Ministry\tof  External\nAffairs\t on  6th  July\t1977 stating  inter  alia  that\t the\nGovernment  decided \"in the interest of the general  public\"\nnot to furnish her copy of the statement of reasons for\t the\nmaking\tof  the order.\tThe petitioner thereupon  filed\t the\npresent\t Writ Petition challenging action of the  Government\nin-  impounding her passport and declining to  give  reasons\nfor doing so.\nThe Act\nwas enacted on 24-4-67 in view of the\ndecision of this Court in Satwant Singg Sawhney's case.\t The\nposition  which obtained prior to the coming into  force  of\nthe  Act was that there was no law regulating the  issue  of\npassports for leaving the shores of India and going  abroad.\nThe  issue of passport was entirely within the unguided\t and\nunchannelled  discretion  of  the  Executive.\tIn   Satwant\nSingh's\t case,\tthis  Court  bell by  a\t majority  that\t the\nexpression  'personal liberty' in\nArticle 21\ntakes  in,\t the\nright  of locomotion and travel abroad and under\nArt. 21\nno\nperson\tcan  be deprived of his right to  go  abroad  except\naccording  to  the  procedure  established  by\tlaw.\tThis\ndecision  was accepted by the Parliament and  the  infirmity\npointed\t but  by it was set right by the  enactment  of\t the\nPassports Act, 1967\n.  The preamble of the Act shows that  it\nwas enacted to provide for the issue of passport and  travel\ndocuments  to regulate the departure from India of  citizens\nof India and other persons and for incidental and  ancillary matters.\tSe\nction 3 provides that no person\t shall\tdenart\nfrom or attempt to depart from India unless he holds in this\n'behalf\t a valid passport or travel document.\nSection\t5(1)\nprovides  for  making  of  an application  for\tissue  of  a\npassport  or travel document for visiting  foreign  country.\nSub-section  (2) of\nsection 5\nsays that on receipt  of\tsuch\napplication  the  Passport  Authority,\tafter  making\tsuch\nenquiry,  if  any, as it may consider necessary,  shall,  by\norder  in writing, issue or refuse to issue the passport  or\ntravel\tdocument or make or refuse to make that passport  or\ntravel document endorsement in\n622\n-respect  of one or more of the foreign countries  specified\nin  the application.  Sub-section (3) requires the  Passport\nAuthority  where it refuses to issue the passport or  travel\ndocument  or to make any endorsement to record in writing  a\nbrief  statement  of  its reasons  for\tmaking\tsuch  order.\nSection\t 6(1)\nlays down the grounds on which  the  Passport\nAuthority  shall refuse to make an endorsement for  visiting\nany foreign country and provides that on no other ground the\nendorsement  shall be refused.\nSection 6(2)\nspecifies\t the\ngrounds on which alone and on no other grounds the  Passport\nAuthority  shall  refuse  to issue the\tPassport  or  travel\ndocument  for  visiting\t any  foreign  country\tand  amongst\nvarious\t grounds  set  out there the last  is  that  in\t the\nopinion\t of the Central Government the issue of passport  or\ntravel\tdocument to the applicant will not be in the  public\ninterest.   Sub-section\t (1)  of\nsection  10\nempowers\t the\nPassport  Authority to vary or cancel the endorsement  on  a\npassport  or travel document or to vary or cancel it on\t the\nconditions  subject to which a passport or  travel  document\nhas been issued having regard to, inter alia, the provisions\nof\ns. 6(1)\nor any notification under\ns. 19\n. Sub-section\t (2)\nconfers\t powers on the Passport Authority to vary or  cancel\nthe  conditions\t of the passport or travel document  on\t the\napplication of the holder of the passport or travel document\nand  with the previous approval of the\tCentral\t Government.\nSub-section  (3)  provides that the Passport  Authority\t may\nimpound\t or  cause to be impounded or revoke a\tpassport  or\ntravel\tdocument on the grounds set out in cl. (a)  to\t(h).\nThe order impounding the passport in the present, case,\t was\nmade by the Central Government under cl. (c) which reads  as\nfollows :-\n\"(c)  If\tthe  passport  authority  deems\t  it\nnecessary\t so  to do in the  interest  of\t the\nsovereignty   and\t integrity  of\tIndia,\t the\nsecurity of India, friendly relations of India\nwith the foreign country, or in the  interests\nof the general public.\"\nSub-section  (5) requires the Passport Authority  impounding\nor  revoking  a passport or travel document  or\t varying  or\ncancelling an endorsement made upon it to record in  writing\na  brief statement of the reasons for making such order\t and\nfurnish to the holder of the passport or travel document  on\ndemand a copy of the same, unless, in any case, the Passport\nAuthority  is  of  the opinion that it will not\t be  in\t the\ninterest  of  the sovereignty and integrity  of\t India,\t the\nsecurity  of  India, friendly relations of  India  with\t any\nforeign country, or in the interest of the general public to\nfurnish\t such  a copy.\tThe Central Government\tdeclined  to\nfurnish\t a copy of this statement of reasons for  impounding\nthe passport of the petitioner on the ground that it was not\nin  the interest of the general public to furnish such\tcopy\nto the petitioner.\nThe petitioner contended.\n1.The  right to go abroad is part of  \"personal\t liberty\"\nwithin the meaning of that expression as used in\nArt. 21\nand\nno one can be deprived of this right except according to the\nprocedure   prescribed\tby  law.   There  is  no   procedure\nprescribed by the\nPassport Act\n, for impounding or revoking a\nPassport.  Even if some procedure can be traced in the\tsaid\nAct  it is unreasonable and arbitrary in as much as it\tdoes\nnot  provide for giving an opportunity to the holder of\t the\nPassport to be heard against the making of the order.\n2.\nSection  10(3) (c)\nis violative of  fundamental  rights\nguaranteed under Articles 14,19(1) (a) and (g) and 21.\n3.The  impugned\t order is made in  contravention  of  the\nrules  of natural justice and is, therefore, null and  void.\nThe  impugned  order has effect of placing  an\tunreasonable\nrestriction  on\t the  right of free  speech  and  expression\nguaranteed to the petitioner under\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nas also\non  the\t right to carry on the profession  of  a  journalist\nconferred under\nArt. 19 (1) (g).\n4.   The impugned order could not consistently with\nArticles\n19(1)(a)\nand (g)be  passed on a mere information of  the\nCentral\t Government that the presence of the  petitioner  is\nlikely\tto  be required in connection with  the\t proceedings\nbefore the Commission of Inquiry.\n623\n5.In  order that a passport may be impounded under\ns.  10\n(3) (c)\n, public interest must actually exist in present\t and\nmere likelihood of public interest .arising in future  would\nbe no ground for impounding the passport.\n6. It was not correct to say that the petitioner was  likely\nto  be\trequired  for  .giving\tevidence  before  the\tShah\nCommission.\nThe  respondents  denied  the  contentions  raised  by\t the\npetitioner.\nBEG, C.

Union of India  [1973]  3\nSCR 530 referred to.\n3.The view that\nArticles 19\nand\n21\nconstitute  watertight\ncompartments has been rightly over-ruled.  The doctrine that\nArticles  19\nand\n21\nprotect or regulate flows  in  different\nchannels, was laid down in A. K. Gopalan's case in a context\nwhich  was very different from that in which  that  approach\nwas displaced by the counter view that the constitution must\nbe  read as an integral whole, with possi, ble\toverlappings\nof the subject matter, of what is sought to be protected  by\nits various provisions, particularly by articles relating to\nfundamental  rights.  The ob. servations in A. K.  Gopalan's\ncase  that  due\t process  with regard  to  law\trelating  to\npreventive  detention  are  to be found in\nArt.\t 22\nof\t the\nConstitution  because it is a self-contained code for  laws.\nThat  observation was the real ratio decidendi of  Gopalan's\ncase.\tOther observations relating to the  separability  of\nthe  subject  matters  of\nArt. 21\nand\n19\nwere\tmere  obiter\ndicta.\t This Court has already held in A. D. M.  Jabalpur's\ncase  by reference to the decision from Gopalan's cast\tthat\nthe  ambit of personal liberty protected by\nArt. 21\nis\twide\nand   comprehensive.   The  questions  relating\t to   either\ndeprivation or restrictions of per sonal liberty, concerning\nlaws falling outside\nArt. 22\nremain really unanswered by the\nGopalan's  case.   The field of 'due process' for  cases  of\npreventive detenu tion is fully covered by\nArt. 22\nbut other\nparts  of that field not covered by Art 22 are\t'unoccupied'\nby  its specific provisions.  In what may be  called  unoccu\n-pied  portions of the vast sphere of personal liberty,\t the\nsubstantive  as well as procedural laws made to cover  them\nmust satisfy the requirements of both Arts 14 and 19 of\t the\nConstitution. [646 E-H, 647 B-D, 648 A-B]\nArticles dealing with different fundamental rights contained\nin  Part HI of the ,Constitution do not\t represent  entirely\nseparate  streams  of rights which do not  ,mingle  at\tmany\npoints.\t  They are all parts of an integrated scheme in\t the\nConstitution.\tTheir  waters must mix\tto  constitute\tthat\ngrand\tflow  unimpeded\t .and  impartial  justice   (social,\neconomic  and  political),  freedom (not  only\tof  thought,\nexpression,   belief,  faith  and  worship,  but   also\t  of\nassociation,  movement vocation or occupation as well as  of\nacquisition  and  possession  of  reasonable  property),  or\nequality (of status and of opportunity, which imply  absence\nof    unreasonable   or\t  unfair   discrimination    between\nindividuals,   groups  and  classes),  and   of\t  fraternity\n(assuring  dignity-of  the individual and the unity  of\t the\nnation)\n624\nwhich  our  Constitution visualfses.  Isolation\t of  various\naspects of human freedom, for purposes of their\t protection,\nis  neither realistic nor beneficial but would\tdefeat\tvery\nobjects of such protection. [648 B-D]\nBlackstone's theory of natural rights cannot be rejected  as\ntotally\t irfelevantIf we have advanced today towards  higher\ncivilization  and  in a more enlightened era we\t cannot\t lag\nbehind\twhat,  at  any\trate,  was  the\t meaning  given\t  to\n'personal. liberty' long ago by Blackstone.  Both the rights\nof personal security and personal liberty recognised by what\nBlackstone  termed 'natural law' are embodied in Act. 21  of\nthe Constitution. [649 A-C, 650 H, 651 A-B]\nA.D. M. Jabalpur vs.  S. S. Shukla [1976] Supp.\t S.C.R.\t 172\nrelied on.\nThe  natural law rights were meant to be converted into\t our\nconstitutionally recognised fundamental rights so that\tthey\nare  to\t be found within it and not outside it.\t To  take  a\ncontrary  view would involve a conflict between natural\t law\nand our constitutional law.  A 'divorce between natural\t law\nand  our constitutional law would be disastrous.   It  would\ndefeat\tone of the basic purposes of our Constitution.\t[652\nB-C]\nThe  total  effect and not the mere form  of  a\t restriction\nwould determine which. fundamental right is really  involved\nin  a  particular case and whether a restriction.  upon\t its\nexercise   is  reasonably  permissible\ton  the\t facts\t and\ncircumstances of that case. [652 H, 653A]\nIf  rights under\nArt. 19\nare rights which inhere  in  Indian\ncitizens,  individuals\tcarry  these  inherent\t fundamental\nconstitutional rights with them-wherever they go, in so\t far\nas  our\t law applies to them, because they are part  of\t the\nIndian National just as Indian ships, flying the Indian flag\nare  deemed  in international law to be\t floating  parts  of\nIndian\tterritory.   This  analogy, however,  could  not  be\npushed\t too  far  because  Indian  citizens,\ton   foreign\nterritory,  are\t only  entitled by virtue  of  their  Indian\nNationality  and Passports to the protection of\t the  Indian\nRepublic  and  the  assistance of  its\tDiplomatic  Missions\nabroad.\t  They cannot claim to be governed abroad  by  their\nown  constitutional  or personal laws which do\tnot  operate\noutside India. [653 A-C]\nIn  order to apply the test contained in Arts. 14 and 19  of\nthe  Constitution we have to consider the objects for  which\nthe exercise of inherent rights recognised by\nArt. 21\nof the\nConstitution  are  restricted as well as  the  procedure  by\nwhich  these  restrictions are sought to  be  imposed,\tboth\nsubstantive and procedural laws and actions taken under them\nwill  have  to pass the test imposed by, Arts.\t14  and\t 19,\nwhenever facts justifying the invocation of either of  these\nArticles  may  be disclosed, for example,  an  international\nsinger\tor  dancer  may\t well be  able\tto  complain  of  an\nunjustifiable restriction on professional activity by denial\nof  a passport.\t In such a case, violation of both Arts.  21\nand 19(1)(g) may be put forward making it necessary for\t the\nauthorities concerned to justify the restriction imposed  by\nshowing\t satisfaction of tests of validity  contemplated  by\neach of 'these two Articles. [653 F-H]\nThe  tests of reason and justice cannot be  abstract.\tThey\ncannot be divorced' from the needs of the nation.  The tests\nhave  to  be  pragmatic otherwise they\twould  cease  to  be\nreasonable.  The discretion left to the authority to impound\na  passport  in Public interest cannot\tinvalidate  the\t law\nitself.\t  We  cannot, out of fear, that such power  will  be\nmisused,  refuse to permit Parliament to entrust  even\tsuch\npower\tto  executive  authorities  as\tmay  be\t  absolutely\nnecessary to carry out the purposes of a validly exercisable\npower.\tIn matters such as, grant, suspension, impounding or\ncancellation  of  passports,  the  possible  dealing  of  an\nindividual  with nationals and authorities of  other  States\nhave  to  be  considered.   The\t contemplated  or   possible\nactivities  abroad  of the individual may have to  be  taken\ninto account.  There may be questions of national safety and\nwelfare\t which transcend the importance of the\tindividual's\ninherent  right\t to  go\t where he  or  she  pleases  to\t go.\nTherefore, the grant of wide discretionary power to the exe-\ncutive authorities cannot be considered as unreasonable\t yet\nthere must be procedural safeguards to ensure that the Power\nwill not be used for purposes extraneous to the grant of the\npower.\t The procedural proprieties must be  insisted  upon.\n[654 A-E]\n625\nA bare, look at the provisions. of\ns. 10(3)\nshows. that each\nof the orders which- could be passed; under\ns. 10(3) (a)\nand\n(b)  requires  a satisfaction of the Passport  Authority  on\ncertain\t objective  conditions which must exist\t in  a\tcase\nbefore it passes an order to impound a passport or a  travel\ndocument.  Impounding or revocation are placed side by\tside\non the same footing in the provisions [654 G-H]\nIt  is clear from the provisions of the Act that there is  a\nstatutory   right  also\t acquired,  on\tfulfilment  of\t the\nprescribed conditions by the holder of a passport, that\t it\nshould continue to be effective for the specified period  so\nlong  as no ground has come into existence for\teither\tits\nrevocation   or\t for  impounding  it  which  amounts  to   a\nsuspension of, it for the time being.  It is true that in  a\nproceedings. under\nArt. 32\n, the Court is concerned only with\nthe,  enforcement of fundamental constitutional\t rights\t and\nnot  with  any\tstatutory  rights  apart  from\tfundamental.\nrights.\nArticle 21\n, however, makes it Clear that violation\nof all law whether statutory or of any other kind is  itself\nan infringement of the guaranteed fundamental right. [655 B-\nD]\nThe  orders under\ns. 10(3)\nmust be based upon some  material\neven  if that material concerns in some cases of  reasonable\nsuspicion  arising from certain credible assertions made  by\nreliable   individuals.\t  In  an  emergent  situation,\t the\nimpounding  of a passport may become necessary without\teven\ngiving an opportunity to be heard against such a step  which\ncould  be  reversed  after an opportunity is  given  to\t the\nholder of the passport to show why the step was unnecessary.\nHowever,  ordinarily no passport could be reasonably  either\nimpounded  or revoked without giving a prior opportunity  to\nits  holder to show cause against the proposed action.\t[655\nD-E]\nIt  is\twell-settled  that even when there  is\tno  specific\nprovision in a statute or rules made thereunder for  showing\ncase  against  action  proposed\t to  be\t taken\tagainst\t  an\nindividual,  which affects the right of that individual\t the\nduty  to  give reasonable opportunity to be  heard  will  be\nimplied from the nature of the function to be perform,,,' by\nthe  authority\twhich  has the power  to  take\tpunitive  or\ndamaging action.

(N.\t S.)\n180 quoted with approval.\nAn   order  impounding\ta  passport  must  be  made   quasi-\njudicially.   This  was not done in the\t present  case.\t  It\ncannot be said that a good enough reason has been shown\t too\nexist  for impounding the passport of the  petitioner.\t The\npetitioner had no opportunity of showing that the ground for\nimpounding  it given in this Court either does not exist  or\nhas  no\t bearing on public interest or that the\t public\t in-\nterest can be better served in some other manner.  The order\nshould\tbe quashed and the respondent should be directed  to\ngive an opportunity to the petitioner to show cause  against\nany proposed action on such grounds as may be available.\n[656 E-G]\nThere were no pressing grounds with regard to the petitioner\nthat  the  immediate action of impounding her  passport\t was\ncalled\tfor.   The  rather cavalier  fashion  in  which\t the\ndisclosure of any reason for impounding of her passport\t was\ndenied\tto  the petitioner despite the fact  that  the\tonly\nreason said to exist is the possibility of her being  called\nto  give  evidence before a Commission of Inquiry.   Such  a\nground is not such as to be reasonably deemed to necessitate\nits concealment in public interest. [656 G-H]\nEven executive authorities when taking administrative action\nwhich involves any deprivation of or restriction on inherent\nfundamental  rights of citizens must take care to  see\tthat\njustice is not only done but manifestly appears to be  done.\nThey have a duty to proceed in a way which is free from even\nthe   appearance  of  arbitrariness,   unreasonableness\t  or\nunfairness.  They have to act in a manner which is  patently\nimpartial and meets the requirements of natural justice [657\nA-B]\n62 6\nAs the undertaking given by the Attorney General amounts  to\nan offer to deal with the petitioner justly and fairly after\ninforming  her of any ground that may exist  for  impounding\nher passport, no further action by this Court is  necessary.\n[657 C-D]\nThe impugned order must be quashed and Passport\t Authorities\nbe  directed  to  return the  passport\tto  the\t petitioner.\nPetition allowed with costs. [657D]\nChandrachud, J. (concurring with Bhagwati, J.)\nThe power to refuse to disclose the reasons for impounding a\npassport  is  of an exceptional nature and it  ought  to  be\nexercised fairly, sparingly and only when fully justified by\nthe  exigencies\t of an uncommon situation.  The\t reasons  if\ndisclosed, being open to judicial scrutiny for\tascertaining\ntheir  nexus  with the order impounding\t the  passport,\t the\nrefusal\t to disclose the reasons would also be open  to\t the\nscrutiny  of  the court; or else the wholesome\tpower  of  a\ndispassionate judicial examination of executive orders could\nwith impunity be set at nought by an obdurate  determination\nto  suppress  the reasons.  The disclosure  made  under\t the\nstress\tof the Writ Petition that the petitioner's  passport\nwas  impounded\tbecause,  her  presence\t was  likely  to  be\nrequired  in  connection  with\tthe  proceedings  before   a\nCommission of Inquiry, could easily have been made when\t the\npetitioner  called upon the Government to let her  know\t the\nreasons why her passport was impounded. [658 A-D]\nIn  Satwant  Singh  Sawhney's  case  this  Court  ruled,  by\nmajority, that the expression personal liberty which  occurs\nin\nArt. 21\nof the Constitution includes the right to  travel\nabroad\tand  that no person can be deprived  of\t that  right\nexcept according to procedure established by law.  The\tmere\nprescription of some kind of procedure cannot even meet\t the\nmandate of\nArticle 21.\nThe procedure prescribed by law\t has\nto be fair, just and reasonable, not fanciful, oppressive or\narbitrary.  The question whether the procedure prescribed by\nlaw  which  curtails  or takes\taway  the  personal  liberty\nguaranteed  by\nArt.  21\nis reasonable or  not\t has  to  be\nconsidered   not   in  the  abstract  or   on\thypothetical\nconsiderations like the provision for a full-dressed hearing\nas  in a court room trial but in the contest, primarily,  of\nthe  purpose  which the Act is intended to  achieve  and  of\nurgent situations which those who are charged with the\tduty\nof  administering the Act may be called upon to\t deal  with.\nSecondly, even the fullest compliance with the\trequirements\nof\nArt.  21\nis not the journey's end because  a  law  which\nprescribes  fair and reasonable procedure for curtailing  or\ntaking\taway  the personal liberty granted by\nArt.  21\nhas\nstill  to meet a possible challenge under the  other  provi-\nsions of the Constitution.  In the Bank Nationalisation case\nthe  majority  held that the assumption in A.  K.  Gopalan's\ncase  that certain Articles of the Constitution\t exclusively\ndeal  with specific matters cannot be accepted\tas  correct.\nThough the Bank Nationalisation case was concerned with\t the\ninter-relationship  of Arts. 31 and 19 and not of  Arts.  21\nand  19, the basic approach adopted therein as\tregards\t the\nconstruction   of  fundamental\trights\tguaranteed  in\t the\ndifferent  provisions  of  the\tConstitution   categorically\ndiscarded  the\tmajor premise of the  majority\tjudgment  in\nGopalan's case. [658 D-G, 659 A-B]\nThe  test  of directness of the impugned law  as  contrasted\nwith  its consequence was thought in A. K. Gopalan  and\t Ram\nSingh's case to be the true approach for determining whether\na   fundamental\t  right\t was   infringed.    A\t significant\napplication  of\t that  test may be perceived  in  Naresh  S.\nMirajkar's  case  where an order passed by the\tBombay\tHigh\nCourt prohibiting the publication of a witness's evidence in\na  defamation  case was upheld by this Court on\t the  ground\nthat  it was passed with the object of affording  protection\nto  the\t witness in order to obtain true  evidence  and\t its\nimpact on the right of free speech and expression guaranteed\nby\nArt.  19 (1) (a)\nwas incidental.  N. H. Bhagwati  J.  in\nExpress\t Newspapers Case struck a modified note by  evolving\nthe  test of proximate effect and operation of the  Statute.\nThat  test saw its fruition in Sakal Paper's case where\t the\nCourt  giving precedence to the direct and immediate  effect\nof the order over the form and object, struck down the Daily\nNewspapers (Price and Page) Order, 1960, on the ground\tthat\nit  violated\nArticle  19(1)(a)\nof  the\t Constitution.\t The\nculmi-\n627\nnation\tof  this  thought process was reached  in  the\tBank\nNationalisation\t case  where it was held  by  the  majority,\nspeaking  through  Shah\t J, that the  extent  of  protection\nagainst the impairment of a fundamental right is  determined\nby  the direct operation of an action upon the\tindividual's\nrights\tand not by the object of the Legislature or  by\t the\nform  of  the action. In Bennett Coleman's  case  the  Court\nreiterated the same position.  It struck down the  newsprint\npolicy restricting the number of pages of newspapers without\nthe  option to reduce the circulation as  offending  against\nthe provisions of\nArt. 19(1)(a).\n[659F-H, 660 A-C]\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nguarantees to Indian Citizens the right  to\nfreedom\t of speech and expression.  It does not delimit\t the\ngrant  of  that right in any manner and there is  no  reason\narising\t either out of interpretational dogmas or  pragmatic\nconsiderations why courts should strain the language of\t the\nArticle\t to  cut down amplitude of that\t right.\t  The  plain\nmeaning\t  of  the  clause  guaranteeing\t free\tspeech\t and\nexpression is that Indian citizens are entitled to  exercise\nthat  right wherever they choose regardless of\tgeographical\nconsiderations. [661 A-D]\nThe Constitution does not confer any power on the  executive\nto prevent the exercise by an Indian citizen of the right of\nfree   speech\tand  expression\t on   foreign\tsoil.\t The\nConstitution guarantees certain fundamental freedoms  except\nwhere\t their\t exercise   is\t limited   by\t territorial\nconsiderations.\t Those freedoms may be exercised wheresoever\none  chooses  subject to the  exceptions  or  qualifications\nmentioned  in\nArt. 19\nitself.  The right to go out of  India\nis  not\t an integral part of the right of  free\t speech\t and\nexpression.   The  analogy  of the freedom  of\tpress  being\nincluded  in  the  right of free speech\t and  expression  is\nwholly\tmisplaced  because  the\t right\tof  free  expression\nincontrovertibly  includes  the right of freedom  of  press.\nThe  right  to go abroad on one hand and the right  of\tfree\nspeech and expression on the other are made up basically  of\nconstituents so different that one cannot be comprehended in\nthe  other.  The presence of the due process clause  in\t the\n5th  and 14th amendments of the American Constitution  makes\nsignificant difference to the approach of American Judges to\nthe definition and evaluation of constitutional\t guarantees.\nThis Court rejected the contention that the freedom. to form\nassociations or unions contained in\nArticle 19(1)(c)\ncarried\nwith  it the right that a workers , union could do all\tthat\nwas  necessary\tto  make that right effective  in  order  to\nachieve the purpose for which the union was formed. [See the\ndecision in All India Bank Employees Association. [661 F, H,\n662 A-13, E]\nBhagwati,  J. (for himself Untwalia and Murtaza\t Fazal\tAli,\nJJ)\nThe  fundamental  rights  in Part III  of  the\tConstitution\nrepresent  the basic values cherished by the people of\tthis\ncountry\t since\tthe Vedic times and they are  calculated  to\nprotect the dignity of the individual and create  conditions\nin  which every human being can develop his  personality  to\nthe  fullest extent.  But these freedoms are not and  cannot\nbe  absolute, for absolute and unrestricted freedom  of\t one\nmay  be\t destructive of the freedom of another.\t In  a\twell\nordered\t civilised  society, freedom can only  be  regulated\nfreedom.   It is obvious that\nArticle 21\nthough\t couched  in\nnegative  language  confers fundamental right  to  life\t and\npersonal   liberty.    The   question\tthat   arises\t for\nconsideration  on the language of\nArt. 21\nis as to  what  is\nthe  meaning and content of the words .personal liberty'  as\nused  in  this Article.\t In A. K. Gopalan's  case  a  narrow\ninterpretation\twas placed on the words 'personal  liberty.'\nBut  there was no definite pronouncement made on this  point\nsince  the  question before the court was not  so  much\t the\ninterpretation of the words 'personal liberty' as the inter-\nrelation  between Arts. 19 and 21.

[1964] 1 SCR 332 referred to.\nIn Kharak Singh's case the majority of this Court held\tthat\n'personal  liberty' is used in the Article as a\t compendious\nterm to include within itself all varieties of Tights  which\ngo to make up the personal liberties of man other than those\ndealt  with  in\t several  clauses  of\nArticle\t19(1).\nThe\nminority however took the view that the expression  personal\nliberty is a comprehensive one and the right to move  freely\nis an attribute of personal liberty.  The minority  observed\nthat  it was not right to exclude any attribute of  personal\nliberty from the scope\n628\nand  ambit of\nArt. 21\non the ground that it was\t covered  by\nArt.  19(1)\nIt was pointed out by the,  minority\tthat\nboth\nArticles 19(1)\nand\n21\nare  independent\tfundamental\nrights though there is a certain amountof overlapping;\tand\nthere is no question of one being carved out of another. The\nminority view  was upheld as correct and it was pointed\t out\nthat it wouldnot be tight to read the expression 'personal\nliberty' in\nArt. 21\nin a narrowand  restricted sense  so\nas to exclude those attributes of personal liberty which are\nspecifically  dealt with in\nArt. 19(1).\nThe attempt of\t the\nCourt  should  be  to expand, the reach\t and  ambit  of\t the\nfundamental  rights rather than attenuate their meaning\t and\ncontent\t  by  a\t process  of  judicial\tconstruction.\t The\nwavelength  for\t comprehending the scope and  ambit  of\t the\nfundamental  rights  has been set by the Court\tin  R.\t  C.\nCooper's    case  and  the approach of\tthe  Court  in,\t the\ninterpretation of the fundamental rights must now be in tune\nwith this wave length.\tThe expression 'personal liberty' in\nArt.  21\nis of the widest amplitude and covers a variety  of\nrights\twhich go to constitute the personal liberty  of\t man\nand some of them have been raised to the status of  distinct\nfundamental,  rights and given additional  protection  under\nArt.  19(1).\nThus\nArticles 19(1)\nand\n21\nare  not  mutually\nexclusive.

The State of West Bengal & Ors. followed.\nThis  Court  held  in case of Satwant  Singh  that  personal\nliberty\t within\t the meaning of\nArt. 21\nincludes  with\t its\nambit the right to go abroad and consequently no person\t can\nbe  deprived  of this right except  according  to  procedure\nprescribed  by\tlaw.   Obviously, the  procedure  cannot  be\narbitary, unfair or unreasonable.  The observations in A. K.\nGopalan's  case\t support  this view  and  apart\t from  these\nobservations, even on principle, the concept of\t reasonable-\nness must be projected in the procedure contemplated by\nArt.\n21\n,  having regard to the impact of\nArt. 14\non\nArt.21.\n[671\nA, D, G-H]\nThe  decision  of  the\tmajority in  A.\t K.

This doctrine of\t exclusivity\nwas  overruled by a majority of the Court in R. C.  Cooper's\ncase.  The ratio of the majority judgment in R. C.

[680 A]\nThe power conferred on the Passport Authority is to  impound\na  passport  and the consequence of  impounding\t a  passport\nwould be to impair the constitutional right of the holder of\nthe passport to go abroad during the time that the  passport\nis impounded.  The passport can be impounded only on certain\nspecified grounds set out in\nsection 10(3)\nand the  Passport\nAuthority  would  have to apply its mind to  the  facts\t and\ncircumstances of a given case and decide whether any of\t the\nspecified  grounds exists which would Justify impounding  of\nthe passport.  The authority is also required by\ns. 10(5)\nto\nrecord\tin  writing  a brief statement of  the\treasons\t for\nmaking\tthe order impounding a passport and save in  certain\nexceptional situations, the authority is obliged to' furnish\na  copy\t of the statement of reasons to the  holder  of\t the\npassport.  Where the Passport Authority which has  impounded\na  passport is other than the Central Government a right  of\nappeal against the order impounding the passport is given by\nsection\t 11\n.   Thus,  the power conferred  on  the  Passport\nAuthority  to impound a passport is a  quasijudicial  power.\nThe  rules of natural justice would in the circumstances  be\napplicable  in\tthe exercise of the power  of  impounding  a\npassport even on the orthodox view which prevailed prior  to\nA.  K. Kraipak's case.\tThe same result must follow in\tview\nof  the decision in A. K. Kraipak's case, even if the  power\nto  impound  a passport were regarded as  administrative  in\ncharacter,   because  it  seriously  interferes\t  with\t the\nconstitutional\tright  of the holder of the passport  to  go\nabroad and entails adverse civil consequences.\tThe argument\nof  the Attorney General however was that having  regard  to\nthe  nature  of the action involved in the impounding  of  a\npassport,  the audi alteram partem rule must be held  to  be\nexcluded because if notice were to be given to the holder of\nthe  passport and reasonable opportunity afforded to him  to\nshow cause why his passport should not be impounded he might\nimmediately  on the strength of the passport make  good\t his\nexit  from  the country and the object of  impounding  etc.,\nwould be frustrated.  Now it is true that there may be cases\nwhere,\thaving\tregard\tto the nature of the  action  to  be\ntaken, its object and purpose and the scheme of the relevant\nstatutory   provision,\tfairness  in  action   may   warrant\nexclusion  of the audi alteram partem rule.   Indeed,  there\nare  certain wellrecognised exceptions to the  audi  alteram\nPartem\trule  established  by  judicial\t decisions.    These\nexceptions, do not in any way militate against the principle\nwhich requires fair play in administrative action.  The word\nexception is really a misnomer because in these\t exceptional\ncases the audi alteram partem rule is held inapplicable\t not\nby  way\t of an exception to fairplay in action\tbut  because\nnothing\t unfair\t can  be  inferred  by\tnot  conferring\t  an\nopportunity to present or meet a case.\tThe life of the\t law\nis  not\t logic\tbut  experience.   Therefore,  every   legal\nproposition  must in the ultimate analysis be tested  on  Me\ntouch-stone of pragmatic realism. [680 B-F, H, 681 C-F]\nThe  audi  alteram  partem  rule  may,\ttherefore,  by\t the\nexperiential test, be excluded, if importing the right to be\nheard  has  the\t effect\t of  paralysing\t the  administrative\nprocess\t or the need for promptitude or the urgency  of\t the\nsituation  so  demands.\t But, at the same time, it  must  be\nremembered  that this is a rule of vital importance  in\t the\nfield  of administrative law and it must not  be  jettisoned\nsave  in  very exceptional  circumstances  where  Compulsive\nnecessity  so demands.\tIt is a wholesome rule\tdesigned  to\nsecure the rule of law and the Court should not be too ready\nto eschew it in its application to a given case.  The  Court\nmust make every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to\t the\nmaximum\t extent\t permissible  in a  given  case.   The\taudi\nalteram\t partem\t rule  is  not cast in\ta  rigid  mould\t and\njudicial decisions establish that it may stiffer situational\nmodifications.\t The  core  of\tit  must,  however,  remain,\nnamely,\t that  the  person  affected  must  have  reasonable\nopportunity'  of  being\t heard and the hearing\tmust  be  a\ngenuine hearing and not an empty public relations  exercise.\nIt  would, not therefore be right to conclude that the\taudi\nalteram partem? rule is excluded merely because the power to\nimpound a passport might be frustrated, if prior notice\t and\nhearing\t were  to be given to the  person  concerned  before\nimpounding his passport.  The passport Authority may proceed\nto impound the passport without giving any prior opportunity\nto  the\t person concerned to be heard, but as  soon  as\t the\norder impounding\n631\nthe Passport is made, an opportunity of hearing, remedial in\naim, should be given to him so that he may present his\tcase\nand controvert that of the\nPassport Authority and point out why his passport should not\nbe  impounded  and the order impounding it  recalled.\tThis\nshould\tnot  only be possible but  also\t quite\tappropriate,\nbecause the reasons for impounding the passport are required\nto be supplied by the Passport Authority after the making of\nthe order and the person affected would, therefore, be in  a\nposition to make a representation setting forth his case and\nplead for setting aside the action impounding his  passport.\nA fair opportunity of being heard following immediately upon\nthe order impounding the Passport would satisfy the  mandate\nof natural justice and a provision requiring giving of\tsuch\nopportunity  to the person concerned can and should be\tread\nby  implication in the\nPassports Act\n.  If such\ta  provision\nwere  held  to\tbe  incorporated in  the  Act  by  necessary\nimplication   the  procedure  prescribed  by  the  Act\t for\nimpounding  a  passport would be right, fair  and  just\t and\nwould  not  suffer from\t arbitrainess  or  unreasonableness.\nTherefore, the procedure established by the\nPassport Act\nfor\nimpounding a passport must be held to be in conformity\twith\nthe  requirement of\nArt. 21\nand does not fall foul  of\tthat\nArticle. [681 G-H, 682 A-C, E-H, 683 A-B]\nIn  the\t present case, however, the Central  Government\t not\nonly  did  not\tgive  an  opportunity  of  hearing  of\t the\npetitioner  after making the impugned order  impounding\t her\npassport but even declined to furnish to the petitioner\t the\nreasons for impounding her passport despite requests made by\nher.   The  Central  Government was  wholly  unjustified  in\nwithholding the reasons for impounding the passport and this\nwas  not only in breach of the statutory provisions  but  it\nalso  amounted\tto denial of opportunity of hearing  to\t the\npetitioner.   The  order  impounding  the  passport  of\t the\npetitioner was, therefore, clearly in violation of the\trule\nof natural justice embodied in the maxim audi alteram partem\nand  was not in conformity with the procedure prescribed  by\nthe  Act.   The learned Attorney General,  however,  made  a\nstatement  on  behalf of the Government of  India  that\t the\nGovernment  was agreeable to considering any  representation\nthat  may  be  made  by the petitioner\tin  respect  of\t the\nimpounding of her passport and giving her an opportunity  in\nthe matter, and that the representation would be dealt\twith\nexpeditiously  in  accordance  with  law.   This   statement\nremoves the vice from the order impounding the passport\t and\nit can no longer be assailed on the ground that it does\t not\ncomply with the audi alteram partem rule or is not in accord\nwith the procedure prescribed by the Act. [683 C-G]\nThe  law is well settled that when a statute vests  unguided\nand unrestricted power in an authority to affect the  rights\nof  a  person without laying down any  policy  or  principle\nwhich is to guide the authority,, in exercise of the  power,\nit would be affected by the vice of discrimination since  it\nwould leave it open to the authority to discriminate between\npersons\t and  things  similarly situated.   However,  it  is\ndifficult  to  say  that the  discretion  conferred  on\t the\npassport  authority is arbitrary or unfettered.\t  There\t are\nfour grounds set out in\nsection 10(3)(c)\nwhich would justify\nthe making of an order impounding a passport. [684C-D]\nThe words \"in the interest of the general public\" cannot  be\ncharacterised as vague or undefined.  The expression \"in the\ninterest  of the general public\" has clearly a well  defined\nmeaning and the Courts have often been called upon to decide\nwhether\t a particular action is in the interest\t of  general\npublic\tor  in public interest and no  difficulty  has\tbeen\nexperienced  by\t the Courts in carrying out  this  exercise.\nThese  words are in fact borrowed ipsissima verba  from\t Art\n19(5) and it would be nothing short of heresay to accuse the\nconstitution makers of vague and loose thinking.  Sufficient\nguidelines  are\t provided by the Act itself  and  the  power\nconferred  on the Passport Authority to impound\t a  passport\ncannot\tbe said to be unguided or unfettered.  Moreover\t the\nexercise  of  this  power  is  not  made  dependent  on\t the\nsubjective opinion of the Passport Authority as regards\t the\nnecessity of exercising it on one or more grounds stated  in\nS.10(3)(c)\n, but the Passport Authority is required to record\nin  writing a brief statement of reasons for impounding\t the\npassport  and  save in\tcertain\t exceptional  circumstances,\nsupply\ta  copy of such statement of reasons to\t the  person\naffected  so  that the person concerned\t can  challenge\t the\ndecision of the Passport Authority in appeal and the  Appel-\nlate Authority can examine whether the reasons given by\t the\nPassport Autho-\n632\nrity  are correct and if so whether they justify the  making\nof the order impounding the passport.  It is true that\twhen\nthe  order  impounding the passport is made by\tthe  Central\nGovernment  there is no appeal against it.  But it  must  be\nremembered that in such a case the power is exercised by the\nCentral Government itself and it can safely be assumed\tthat\nthe  Central Govt. will exercise the power in  a  reasonable\nand  responsible  manner.  When power is vested\t in  a\thigh\nauthority like the Central Government abuse of power  cannot\nbe  lightly assumed and in any event, if there is  abuse  if\nthe power the arms of the Court are long enough to reach  it\nand to strike it down.\tThe power conferred on the  Passport\nAuthority  to  impound a passport under\nsection  10(3)\t (c)\ncannot be regarded as discriminatory.

[1966] 3 SCR 744, [685 D-G, 686-B]\nAccording to these decisions, the theory was that the object\nand form of state action determine the extent of  protection\nwhich  may be claimed by an individual and the\tvalidity  of\nsuch  action has to be judged by considering whether  it  is\n\"directly   in\trespect\t of  the  subject  covered  by\t any\nparticular  article of the Constitution or touches the\tsaid\narticle\t only incidentally or indirectly\".  The test  to  be\napplied for determining the constitutional validity of state\naction\twith fundamental right therefore was : what  is\t the\nobject\tof the authority in taking the action : What is\t the\nsubject matter of the action and to which fundamental  right\ndoes it relate ? This theory that \"the extent of  protection\nof important guarantees, such as the liberty of persons\t and\nright  to property, depend upon the form and object  of\t the\nstate  action  not  upon  its  direct  operation  upon\t the\nindividual's freedom\" held sway, in spite of three decisions\nof the Supreme Court in Dwarkadass Srinivas v.

Cooper v. Union of India [1973]\n3 SCR 530 that the doctrine that the object and form of\t the\nState  action alone determine the extent of protection\tthat\nmay  be claimed by an individual and that the effect of\t the\nState  action on the fundamental right of the individual  is\nirrelevant  as\tlaid  down in  Gopalan's  case\twas  finally\nrejected.  This doctrine is in substance and reality nothing\nelse  than the test of pith and substance which\t is  applied\nfor  determining the constitutionality of legislation  where\nthere is conflict of legislative powers conferred on Federal\nand State legislatures with reference to legislative  lists.\n[685 H, 686 A-B, D-H, 687 A-E, F-G]\nThe test applied since R.C. Cooper's case was as to what  is\nthe  direct  and  inevitable consequence or  effect  of\t the\nimpugned  state\t action\t on the\t fundamental  right  of\t the\npetitioner.   It is possible that in a given case  the\tpith\nand substance of the State action may deal with a particular\nfundamental  right but its direct and inevitable effect\t may\nbe on another fundamental right and in that case, the  state\naction\twould  have  to meet the  challenge  of\t the  latter\nfundamental  right.  The pith and substance  doctrine  looks\nonly  at the object and subject matter of the state  action,\nbut  in\t testing  the  validity of  the\t state\taction\twith\nreference  to  fundamental  rights,  what  the\tCourts\tmust\nconsider  is  the direct and inevitable consequence  of\t the\nState  action.\tOtherwise the protection of the\t fundamental\nrights would subtly but surely eroded.\n[690\nB-D]\nA.

The case before us involves questions relating  to\nbasic  human  rights.\tOn such\t questions  I  believe\tthat\nmultiplicity of views giving the approach of each member  of\nthis  Court  is not a disadvantage if it clarifies  our\t not\ninfrequently  differing\t approaches.  It should\t enable\t all\ninterested to appreciate better the significance of our Con-\nstitution.\nAs  I  am  in general agreement\t with  my  learned  brethren\nBhagwati  and Krishna lyer.

I have had the advantage\nof  going through the opinions of each of my  three  learned\nbrethren.\nIt seems to me that there can be little doubt that the right\nto  travel  and\t to go outside\tthe  country,  which  orders\nregulating issue, suspension or impounding, and cancellation\nof passports directly affect, must be included in rights  to\n\"personal  liberty\"  on the strength of\t decisions  of\tthis\nCourt  giving  a very wide ambit to the\t right\tto  personal\nliberty\t (see  :\nSatwant Singh Sawhney\tv.

K.  Gopalan\nv. State of Madras\n,(1) where, as pointed out by me in  Addi-\ntional\nDistrict Magistrate, Jabalpur v. S\n. S.\t Shukla\t and\nothers(2)  with\t the help of quotations\t from  judgments  of\nPatanjli  Sastri,  J. (from p. 195 to 196), Mahajan  J.\t (p.\n229-230),  Das\tJ.  (295 and 306-307).\tI  may\tadd  to\t the\npassages  cited there some from the judgment of Kania  Chief\nJustice\t who  also,  while distinguishing  the\tobjects\t and\nnatures\t of\narticles 21\nand\n19\n, gave a wide enough scope  to\nArt. 21.\nKania CJ said (at p. 106-107)\n\"Deprivation   (total   loss)   of   personal\nliberty,\twhich inter alia includes the  right\nto  eat or sleep when one likes or to work  or\nnot  to  work  as\t and  when  one-pleases\t and\nseveral such rights sought to be protected  by\nthe  expression 'personal liberty' in\narticle\n21\n, is quite different from restriction (which\nis  only\ta partial control) of the  right  to\nmove freely (which is relatively a minor right\nof a citizen) as safeguarded by\narticle  19(1)\n(d).  Deprivation of personal liberty has\t not\nthe  same\t meaning  as  restriction  of\tfree\nmovement\tin the territory of India.  This  is\nmade clear when the provisions of the\nCriminal\nProcedure\t Code\nin Chapter VIII\trelating  to\nsecurity\tof  peace or maintenance  of  public\norder  are  read.\t Therefore\narticle  19\t (5)\ncannot apply to a substantive law depriving  a\ncitizen  of personal liberty.  I am unable  to\naccept   the   contention\t  that\t the\tword\n'deprivation'   includes\twithin\t its   scope\n'restriction'  when interpreting\narticle\t 21.\nArticle  22\nenvisages the law  of  preventive\ndetention.   So  does\narticle  246\nread\twith\nSchedule\tSeven,\tList I, Entry 9,  and  lList\nIII,  Entry 3. Therefore, when the subject  of\npreventive  detention  is\t specifically  dealt\nwith in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights I do\nnot   think  it  is  proper  to\tconsider   a\nlegislation  permitting  preventive  detention as\t in confli\nct with the rights mentioned  in\narticle 19(1).\nArticle 19(1)\ndoes not purport\nto cover all aspects of liberty or of personal\nliberty.\tIn\n(1)   [1950] SCR 88.\n(2)   [1976] Suppl.  SCR 172 at 327.\n645\nthat  article only certain phases\t of  liberty\nare  dealt  with.\t  'Personal  liberty'  would\nprimarily\t mean liberty of the physical  body.\nThe  rights given under\narticle 19(1)\ndo\t not\ndirectly\tcome under that\t description.\tThey\nare  rights  which accompany  the\t freedom  or\nliberty  of the person.  By their very  nature\nthey are freedoms of a person assumed to be in\nfull  possession of his personal liberty.\t  If\narticle  19\nis  considered  to  be  the\tonly\narticle safeguarding personal liberty  several\nwell-recognised_ rights, as for instance,\t the\nright  to\t eat or drink, the  right  to  work,\nplay,  swim  and\tnumerous  other\t rights\t and\nactivities and even the right to life will not\nbe deemed protected under the Constitution.  I\ndo not think that is the intention.  It  seems\nto  me improper to read\narticle 19\nas  dealing\nwith the same subject as\narticle 21.\nArticle\n19\ngives the rights specified therein only  to\nthe  citizens  of India while\narticle  21\nis\napplicable  to all persons.  The word  citizen\nis  expressly defined in the  Constitution  to\nindicate\t only  a  certain  section  of\t the\ninhabitants    of\t  India.    Moreover,\t the\nprotection  given\t by-\narticle  21\nis\tvery\ngeneral.\t  It  is  of  'law'--whatever\tthat\nexpression is interpreted to mean.  The legis-\nlative  restrictions on the law-making  powers\nof the legislature are not here prescribed  in\ndetail as in the case of the rights  specified\nin\narticle  19.\nIn  my\t opinion   therefore\narticle  19\nshould  be  read  as\t a  separate\ncomplete article\".\nIn that case, Mukherjea J., after conceding that the  rights\ngiven by\narticle 19(1) (d)\nwould be incidentally contravened\nby  an\torder  of  preventive detention\t (see  p.  261)\t and\nexpressing  the opinion that a wider significance was  given\nby  Blackstone\tto the term \" personal liberty\",  which\t may\ninclude\t the  right to locomotion, as Mr.  Nambiar,  learned\nCounsel for A. K. Gopalan, wanted the Court to infer, gave a\nnarrower connotation to \"personal liberty\", as \"freedom from\nphysical constraint or coercion\" only.\tMukherjea, J., cited\nDicey for his more restrictive view that \"personal  liberty\"\nwould  mean  :\t\"a personal right not  to  be  subjected  to\nimprisonment,  arrest  or  other physical  coercion  in\t any\nmanner that does not admit of legal justification\".  He then\nsaid\n\"It is, in my opinion, this negative right  of\nnot  being subjected to any form\tof  physical\nrestraint\t or  coercion that  constitutes\t the\nessence  of  personal  liberty  and  not\tmere\nfreedom  to  move to any part  of\t the  Indian\nterritory\".\nAfter  referring to the views of the Drafting  Committee  of\nour Constitution Mukherjea, J., said : (p. 963) :\n\"It is enough to say at this stage that if the\nreport   of  the\tDrafting  Committee  is\t  an\nappropriate    material\tupon\twhich\t the\ninterpretation\tof   the   words   of\t the\nConstitution-  could  be based,  it  certainly\ngoes  against the contention of the  applicant\nand  it shows that the words used\t in\narticle\n19(1) (d)\nof the Constitution do not mean\t the\nsame thing as the expression\n3-119SCI/78\n646\npersonal\tliberty' in\narticle 21\ndoes.  It  is\nwell known that the word 'liberty' standing by\nitself  has been given a very wide meaning  by\nthe  Supreme  Court of the- United  States  of\nAmerica.\t  It  includes\tnot  only   personal\nfreedom from physical restraint but the  right\nto  the free use of one's own property and  to\nenter into free contractual relations.  In the\nIndian  Constitution, on the other  hand,\t the\nexpression   'personal   liberty'\t  has\tbeen\ndeliberately  used to restrict it\t to  freedom\nfrom   physical\trestraint   of\t person\t  by\nincarceration or otherwise\".\nFazal Ali, J., however, said (at p. 148)\n\"To my mind, the scheme of the Chapter dealing\nwith   the   fundamental\t rights\t  does\t not\ncontemplate what is attributed to it,  namely,\nthat each article is a code by itself and is\nindependent of the others. Inmy  opinion\tit\ncannot be\t said that\narticles 19\n, 20\n, 21\nand22\ndo not to some extent overlap each other.\t The\ncase ofa\tperson\twho is convicted  of  an\noffence will come under\narticle 20\nand\n21\nand\nalso under\narticle 22\nso far as his arrest and\ndetention\t  in   custody\tbefore\t trial\t are\nconcerned.   Preventive  detention,  which  is\ndealt  with  in\narticle 22\n,  also\t amounts  to\ndeprivation  of  personal\t liberty  which\t  is\nreferred to in\narticle 21\n, and is a  violation\nof the right of freedom of movement dealt with\nin\narticle 19(1) (d).\nThat there  are  other\ninstances\t of overlapping of articles  in\t the\nConstitution  may be illustrated by  reference\nto\narticle 19(1) (f)\nand\narticle 31\nboth  of\nwhich  deal with the right to property and  to\nsome extent overlap each other\".\nAs  has been pointed out by my learned brother Bhagwati,  by\ndetailed  references to cases, such as\nHaradhan Saha v.\t The\nState  of  West Bengal & Ors\n(\n1) and Shambhu Nath  Sarkar  v.\nState of West Bengal\n(2) , the view that\nArticles 19\nand\n21\nconstitute water tight compartments, so that all aspects  of\npersonal  liberty could be excluded from\nArticle 19\nof\t the\nConstitution,  had to be abandoned as a result of  what\t was\nheld,  by  a larger bench of this Court in R. C.  Cooper  v.\nUnion  of India(3), to be the sounder view.   Therefore,  we\ncould  ,neither revive that overruled doctrine nor could  we\nnow hold that impounding or cancellation of a passport\tdoes\nnot  impinge upon and affect fundamental rights\t guaranteed,\nby the Constitution.\nI may point out that the doctrine that\nArticles  19\nand\n21\nprotect or regulate flows  in  different\nchannels,  which certainly appears to have found  favour  in\nthis Court in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case (supra), was\nlaid down in\na  context which was very different from that in which\tthat\napproach  was  displaced  by  the  sounder  view  that\t the\nConstitution  must  be\tread  as  an  integral\twhole,\twith\npossible  over-lappings\t of the subject matter\tof  what  is\nsought\tto  be\tprotected by  its  various  provisions\tpar-\nticularly by articles relating to fundamental rights.\n(1)  [1975] 1 SCR778.\n(2)  [1973] 1 SCR 856.\n(3)  [1973] 3 SCR 530.\n647\nIn\nA.\tK.  Gopalan\n's case (supra), what was  at  issue\t was\nwhether\t the  tests was valid procedure for  deprivation  of\npersonal  liberty  by  preventive detention  must  be  found\nexclusively  in\nArticle 22\nof the Constitutions or could  we\ngather from outs de it also elements of any \"due process  of\nlaw\" and use them to test the validity of a law dealing with\npreventive   detention.\t  Our\tConstitution-makers,   while\naccepting  a departure, from ordinary norms.  by  permitting\nmaking\tof laws for preventive detention without  trial\t for\nspecial\t reasons  in exceptional  situations  also  provided\nquite  elaborately,  in\nArticle  22\nof  the\tConstitution\nitself,' whit requirements such law, relating to  preventive\ndetention,  must  satisfy.  The procedural  requirements  of\nsuch   laws  separately\t formed\t parts\tof  the\t  guaranteed\nfundamental  rights.  Therefore, when this Court was  called\nupon  to  judge\t the  validity\tof  provisions\trelating  to\npreventive  detention  it\nlaid\t down,\tin\nGopalan's\tcase\n(supra),  that\tthe tests of \"due process\", with  regard  to\nsuch   laws,  are  to  be  found  in\nArticle  22\nof\t the\nConstitution, exclusively because this article constitutes a\nself-contained code for laws of this description.  That was,\nin  my\tview,  the real ratio decidendi\t of  Gopalan's\tcase\n(supra).   It appears to me, with great respect, that  other\nobservations  relating\tto the separability of\tthe  subject\nmatters of\nArticles 21\nand\n19\nwere mere obiter dicta.\nThey\nmay  have  appeared to the  majority of\t learned  Judges  in\nGopalan\n's  case to be extensions of the logic  they  adopted\nwith regard to the relationship between\nArticle 21\nand\n22\nof\nthe Constitution. But,\tthe real issue there was  whether,\nin the face of\nArticle\t22\nof theConstitution,\t     which\nprovides all the tests of procedural validity of alaw\nregulating  preventive\tdetention other tests could  be\t im-\nported from\nArticle 19\nof the Constitution or elsewhere into\n\"procedure established by law\".\t The majority view was\tthat\nthis  could  not  be done.\nI think, if\t I  may\t venture  to\nconjecture what opinions learned Judges of this Court  would\nhave  expressed on that occasion had other types of  law  or\nother  aspects\tof  personal liberty, such  as\tthose  which\nconfronted this Court in either Satwant Singh's case (supra)\nor  Kharak Singh's case (supra) were before them,  the\tsame\napproach or the same language would not have been adopted by\nthem.\tIt  seems to me that this aspect of  Gopalan's\tcase\n(supra)\t is  important to remember if we  are  to  correctly\nunderstand what was laid down in that case.\nI have already referred to the passages I cited in\nA. D.  M.\nJabaipur\n's case (supra) to show that, even in\nGopalan\n's case\n(supra), the majority of judges of this Court took the\tview\nthat (the ambit of personal liberty protected by\nArticle  21\nis  wide  and comprehensive.  It embraces  both\t substantive\nrights\tto personal liberty and the procedure  provided\t for\ntheir  deprivation.\nOne can, however, say that no  question\nof  \"due  process-of  law\"  can\t really\t arise\tapart\tfrom\nprocedural requirements of preventive detention\nlaid down by\nArticle 22\n, in a case such as the one this Court  considered\nin\nGopalan\n's case (supra).  The clear meaning of\nArticle  22\nis  that the requirements of \"due process of law\", in  cases\nof preventive detention, are satisfied by what is,  provided\nby\nArticle 22\nof the Constitution itself.  This article\t in-\ndicates\t the pattern of \"the procedure established  by\tlaw\"\nfor cases of preventive detention.\n648\nQuestions,  however,  relating\tto  either  deprivation\t  or\nrestrictions  of personal liberty, concerning  laws  falling\noutside\nArticle  22\nremained  really  unanswered,  strictly\nspeaking,  by\nGopalan\n's case.\tIf one may so  put  it,\t the\nfield of \"due process\" for cases of preventive detention  is\nfully covered by\nArticle 22\n, but other parts of that  field,\nnot covered by\nArticle 22\n, are \"unoccupied\" by its  specific\nprovisions.   I\t have no doubt that, in what may  be  called\n\"unoccupied\"  portions\tof  the\t vast  sphere  of   personal\nliberty, the substantive as well as procedural laws made  to\ncover them must satisfy the requirements of both\nArticles 14\nand\n19\nof the Constitution.\nArticles dealing with different fundamental rights contained\nin  Part III of the Constitution do not\t represent  entirely\nseparate  streams  of  rights which do not  mingle  at\tmany\npoints.\t  They are all parts of an integrated scheme in\t the\nConstitution.\tTheir  waters must mix\tto  constitute\tthat\ngrand flow of unimpeded and impartial Justice (social,economic\nand political), Freedom (not only of thought, expression,belief,\nfaith  and  worship,  but  also\t of  association,  movement,\nvacationor  occupation\tas  well  as  of  acquisition  and\npossession  of reasonable property), of Equality (of  status\nand  of opportunity, which imply absence of unreasonable  or\nunfair\t discrimination\t between  individuals,\tgroups\t and\nclasses),  and\tof  Fraternity\t(assuring  dignity  of\t the\nindividual  and\t the unity of the nation),  which  our\tCon-\nstitution visualises.  Isolation of various aspects of human\nfreedom,  for  purposes\t of  their  protection,\t is  neither\nrealistic  nor beneficial but would defeat the very  objects\nof such protection.\nWe have to remember that the fundamental rights protected by\nPart  III of the Constitution, out of which\nArticles 14\n,  19\nand\n21\nare the most frequently invoked, form tests  of\t the\nvalidity  of executive as well as legislative  actions\twhen\nthese actions are subjected to judicial scrutiny.  We cannot\ndisable\nArticle 14\nor 19 from so functioning and hold  those\nexecutive and legislative actions to which they could  apply\nas unquestionable even when there is no emergency to  shield\nactions\t of  doubtful  legality.  These\t tests\tare,  in  my\nopinion,     available\t to   us  now\tto   determine\t the\nconstitutional validity of\nSection 10 (3) (c)\nof the Act  as\nwell  as  of the impugned order of 7th\tJuly,  1977,  passed\nagainst\t the  petitioner  impounding her  passport  \"in\t the\ninterest of general public\" and stating that the  Government\nbad  decided not to furnish her with a copy of\treasons\t and\nclaiming  immunity from such disclosure under\nsection  10(5)\nof the Act.\nI  have already mentioned some of the\t authorities  relied\nupon by me in A. D. M. Jabalpur v. S. Shukla (Supra),  while\ndiscussing  the scope of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution,  to\nhold that its ambit is very wide.  I will now indicate\twhy,\nin my view, the particular rights claimed by the  petitioner\ncould  fall  within\nArticles 19\nand 21. and the\t nature\t and\norigin of such rights.\nMukerji\t J.,  in\nGopalan\n's case  (supra)  referred  to\t the\ncelebrated  commentaries  of  Blackstone  on  the  Laws\t  of\nEngland.  It is instructive to reproduce passages from there\neven  though  juristic reasoning may  have  travelled  today\nbeyond the stage reached by it when Blackstone\n649\nwrote.\t Our basic concepts on such matters,  stated  there,\nhave   provided\t  the  foundations   on\t  which\t  subsequent\nsuperstructures\t were  raised. Some  of\t these\tfoundations,\nfortunately, remain intact.  Blackstone said :\n\"This   law  of  nature,\tbeing  coeval\twith\nmankind,\tand dictated by God himself,  is  of\ncourse  superior in obligation to\t any  other.\nIt is binding over all the globe in all  coun-\ntries, and at all times : no human laws are of\nany validity, if contrary to this; and such of\nthem  as are valid derive all their force\t and\nall their authority, mediately or immediately,\nfrom this original.\"\nThe  identification  of\t natural law  with  Divine  will  or\ndictates of God may have, quite understandably, vanished  at\na time when men see God, if they see one anywhere at all, in\nthe highest qualities inherent in the nature of Man himself.\nBut  the  idea\tof a natural law as  a\tmorally\t inescapable\npostulate  of a just order, recognizing the inalienable\t and\ninherent  rights of all men (which term includes  women)  as\nequals before the law persists.\t It is, I think, embedded in\nour  own  Constitution.\t I do not think that we\t can  reject\nBlackstone's theory of natural rights as totally  irrelevant\nfor us today.\nBlackstone propounded his philosophy of natural or  absolute\nrights in the following terms :\n\"The  absolute rights of man, considered as  a\nfree  agent, endowed with discernment to\tknow\ngood  from  evil, and with power\tof  choosing\nthose measures which appear to him to be\tmost\ndesirable,  are  usually\tsummed\tup  in\t one\ngeneral\tappellation,  and  denominated\t the\nnatural  liberty\tof  mankind.   This  natural\nliberty consists properly in a power of acting\nas  one thinks fit, without any  restraint  or\ncontrol, unless by the law of nature; being  a\nright inherent in us by birth,and one of\tthe\ngifts of God to man at his creation,  when     he\nendued him with the faculty of free will.\t But\neveryman, when he enters into society,  gives\nup  a  part of  his natural  liberty,  as\t the\nprice  of\t so  valuable a\t purchase,  and,  in\nconsideration  of receiving the advantages  of\nmutual commerce, obliges himself to conform to\nthose  laws, which the community\thas  thought\nproper  to  establish.  And  this\t species  of\nlegal  obedience and conformity is  infinitely\nmore  desirable  than  that  will\t and  savage\nliberty which is sacrificed to obtain it.\t For\nno  man that considers a moment would wish  to\nretain the absolute and uncontrolled power  of\ndoing whatever he pleases; the consequence  of\nwhich is, that every other man would also have\nthe  same\t power, and then there would  be  no\nsecurity\t to  individuals  in  any   of\t the\nenjoyments of life.  Political, therefore,  or\ncivil  liberty, which is that of a  member  of\nsociety, is no other than natural liberty so\nfar restrained by human laws (and no  farther)\nas is necessary and expedient for the  general\nadvantage of the public.\n650\nThe  absolute  rights  of\t every\t Englishman,\n(which,  taken  in a political  and  extensive\nsense, are usually called their liberties), as\nthey are founded on nature and reason, so they\nare coeval with our form of Government; though\nsubject  at  times to  fluctuate\tand  change;\ntheir establishment (excellent as it is) being\nstill human.\n*\t *  *  And these may  be  reduced  to  three\nprincipal\t or primary articles; the  right  of\npersonal\tsecurity,  the\tright  of   personal\nliberty,\tand the right of  private  property,\nbecause, as there is no other known method  of\ncompulsion,  or abridging man's  natural\tfree\nwill, but by an infringement or diminution  of\none  or other of these important\trights,\t the\npreservation of these, involate, may justly be\nsaid to include the preservation of our  civil\nimmunities in their largest and most extensive\nsense.\nI.The right of personal security\tconsists\nin   a   person's\t legal\t and   uninterrupted\nenjoyment\t of his life, his limbs,  his  body,\nhis health and his reputation.\nII.Next  to personal security, the  law  of\nEngland  regards, asserts, and  preserves\t the\npersonal\t liberty   of\tindividuals.\tThis\npersonal\tliberty\t consists in  the  power  of\nlocomotion,  of changing situation, or  moving\none's  person  to whatsoever place  one's\t own\ninclination  may direct, without\timprisonment\nor  restraint,  unless by due course  of\tlaw.\nConcerning   which  we  may  make\t  the\tsame\nobservations  as upon the\t preceding  article,\nthat it is a right strictly natural; that\t the\nlaws of England have never abridged it without\nsufficient  cause; and that, in this  kingdom,\nit  cannot  ever\tbe  abridged  at  the\tmere\ndiscretion  of  the  magistrate,\twithout\t the\nexplicit permission of the laws.\nIII. The\tthird absolute right,  inherent\t in\nevery  Englishman, is that of property;  which\nconsists\tin  the\t free  use,  enjoyment,\t and\ndisposal of all his acquisitions, without\t any\ncontrol  or diminution, save only by the\tlaws\nof the land, The original of private  property\nis probably founded in nature, as will be more\nfully  explained\tin the second  book  of\t the\nensuing\tcommentaries;  but   certainly\t the\nmodifications  under which we at present\tfind\nit, the method of conserving it in the present\nowner, and of translating it from man to\tman,\nare  entirely  derived from society;  and\t are\nsome  of those civil advantages,\tin  exchange\nfor which every individual has resigned a part\nof his natural liberty.\"\nI  have\t reproduced from Blackstone whose ideas\t may  appear\nsomewhat quaint in an age of irreverence because,  although,\nI know that modern jurisprudence conceives of all rights  as\nrelative or as products of particular socioeconomic  orders,\nyet, the idea that man, as man, morally has certain inherent\nnatural primordial inalienable human rights goes back to the\nvery origins of human jurisprudence.\n651\nIt is found in Greek philosophy.  If we have advanced  today\ntowards\t what we believe to be a higher civilisation and  a\nmore  enlightened  era, we cannot fall behind what,  at\t any\nrate,  was the meaning given to \"personal liberty\" long\t ago\nby  Blackstone.\t As indicated above, it included \"the  power\nof locomotion, of changing situation, or moving one's person\nto  whatsoever\tplace  one's  own  inclination\tmay  direct,\nwithout\t imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course  of\nlaw\".\tI think that both the rights of \"personal  security\"\nand  of cc personal liberty\", recognised by what  Blackstone\ntermed\t\"natural  law\", are embodied in\nArticle\t 21\nof\t the\nConstitution.\tFor this proposition, I relied, in A. D.  M.\nJabalpur v. S. S. Shukla (supra), and I do so again here, on\na  passage from Subba Rao C.J., speaking for five Judges  of\nthis Court in\nI. C. Golaknath v. State of Punjab\n(1) when  he\nsaid (at p. 789) :\n\"Now,  what are the fundamental rights ?\tThey\nare  embodied in Part III of the\tConstitution\nand they may be classified thus: (i) right  to\nequality,\t (ii) right to freedom, (iii)  right\nagainst exploitation, (iv) right to freedom of\nreligion, (v) cultural and educational  rights\n,\t (vi) right to property, and (vii) right  to\nconstitutional remedies.\tThey are the  rights\nof  the people preserved by our  Constitution,\n'Fundamental  rights' are the modem  name\t for\nwhat have been traditionally known as 'natural\nrights'.\t As one author puts it :  'they\t are\nmoral   rights   which   every   human   being\neverywhere  at all times ought to have  simply\nbecause of the fact that in  contradistinction\nwith other beings, he, is rational and moral'.\nThey  are the primordial rights necessary\t for\nthe  development of human\t personality.\tThey\nare the rights which enable a man to chalk out\nhis own life in the manner he likes best.\t Our\nConstitution,  in addition to  the  Well-known\nfundamental  rights, also included the  rights\nof  the  minorities,  untouchables  and  other\nbackward communities, in such right\".\nHidayatullah, J., in the same case said (at p.\n877)\n\"What   I\t have  said  does  not\t mean\tthat\nFundamental  Rights are not subject to  change\nor  modification.\t In the most inalienable  of\nsuch rights a distinction must be made between\npossession  of a right and its exercise.\t The\nfirst  is fixed and the latter  controlled  by\njustice  and  necessity.\t Take  for   example\nArticle 21 :\n'No  person shall be deprived of his  life  or\npersonalliberty\t except\t  according    to\nprocedure established by law\".\nOf all  the rights, the right to one's life is  the\nmost    valuable.\t  This\t article   of\t the\nConstitution,therefore,\tmakes\tthe    right\nfundamental.  But\t the  inalienable  right  is\ncurtailed\t by a murderer's conduct  as  viewed\nunder  law.   The deprivation, when  it  takes\nplace, is not of the right which was immutable\nbut of the continued exercised of right.,'\n(1)   [1967] 2 SCR762.\n652\nIt  is,\t therefore, clear that six out of eleven  Judges  in\nGolak  Nath\n's  case  declared that  fundamental\t rights\t are\nnatural\t rights embodied in the Constitution  itself.\nThis\nview  was affirmed by the majority Judges of this  Court  in\nShukla's case.\tIt was explained by me there at some length.\nKhanna,,  J.,  took  a somewhat\t different  view.   Detailed\nreasons were given by me in Shukla's case (supra) for taking\nwhat  I found to be and still find as the only view I  could\npossibly  take\tif I were not to disregard, as I  could\t not\nproperly do, what had been held by larger benches and what I\nmyself\tconsider to be the correct view : that\tnatural\t law\nrights were, meant to be converted into our Constitutionally\nrecognised  fundamental rights, atleast so far as  they\t are\nexpressly mentioned, so that they are to be found within  it\nand not outside it.  To take a contrary view would involve a\nconflict between natural law and our Constitutional law.   I\nam  emphatically of opinion that a divorce  between  natural\nlaw and our Constitutional law will be disastrous.  It\twill\ndefeat one of the basic purposes of our Constitution.\nThe  implication  of  what I have indicated  above  is\tthat\nArticle\t 21\nis also a recognition and declaration of  rights\nwhich inhere in every individual.  Their existence does\t not\ndepend on the location of the individual.  Indeed, it  could\nbe argued that what so inheres is inalienable and cannot  be\ntaken away at all.  This may seem theoretically correct\t and\nlogical.   But,\t in fact, we are often met with\t denials  of\nwhat  is, in theory, inalienable or \"irrefragible\".   Hence,\nwe  speak  of  \"deprivations\" or  \"restrictions\"  which\t are\nreally\timpediments  to the exercise  of  the  \"inalienable\"\nrights' Such deprivations or restrictions or regulations  of\nrights may take place, within prescribed limits, by means of\neither\tstatutory law or purported actions under  that\tlaw.\nThe degree to which the theoretically recognised or abstract\nright is concretised is thus determined by the balancing  of\nprinciples on which an inherent right is based against those\non  which  a  restrictive law or orders under  it  could  be\nimposed\t upon  its  exercise.  We have\tto  decide  in\teach\nspecific  case, as it arises before us, what the  result  of\nsuch a balancing is.\nIn  judging the validity of either legislative or  executive\nstate action for conflict with any of the fundamental rights\nof individuals, whether they be of citizens or non-citizens,\nthe  question as to where the rights are to be exercised  is\nnot  always  material  or even\trelevant.   If\tthe  persons\nconcerned,  on whom the law or purported action under it  is\nto operate, are outside the territorial jurisdiction of\t our\ncountry,  the  action taken may be  ineffective.   But,\t the\nvalidity  of  the law must be determined  on  considerations\nother  than  this.  The tests of  validity  of\trestrictions\nimposed\t upon  the rights covered by\narticle 19(1)\nwill  be\nfound  in  clauses  (2)\t to (6) of\nArticle  19.\nThere  is nothing  ther\ne to suggest that restrictions on right',  the\nexercise  of which may involve going out of the\t country  or\nsome  activities  abroad are excluded from  the\t purview  of\ntests contemplated by\narticles 19(2)\nto (6). 1 agree with my\nlearned brother Bhagwati, for reasons detailed by him,\tthat\nthe total effect and not the mere form of a restriction will\ndetermine which fundamental right is really involved in a\n653\nparticular case and whether a restriction upon its  exercise\nis  reasonbly permissible on the facts and circumstances  of\nthat case.\nIf rights under\narticle 19\nare rights which inhere in Indian\ncitizens,   individuals\t concerned  carry   these   inherent\nfundamental  constitutional rights with them  wherever\tthey\ngo, in so far as our law applies to them, because they\tare,\nparts of the Indian nation just as Indian ships, flying\t the\nIndian\tflag,  are  deemed,  in\t International\tlaw,  to  be\nfloating parts of Indian territory.  This analogy,  however,\ncould  not  be\tpushed too far because\tIndian\tcitizens  on\nforeign\t territory,  are only entitled, by virtue  of  their\nIndian\tnationality and passports, to the protection of\t the\nIndian\tRepublic  and  the  assistance\tof  its\t  diplomatic\nmissions abroad.  They cannot claim to be governed abroad by\ntheir  own  Constitutional  or personal laws  which  do\t not\noperate outside India.\tBut, that is not the position in the\ncase  before us. So far as the impugned action in  the\tcase\nbefore\tus is concerned, it took place in India and  against\nan Indian citizen residing in India.\nIn India, at any rate, we are all certainly governed by\t our\nConstitution.\tThe  fact that the affected  petitioner\t may\nnot,  as  a  result of a particular order,  be\table  to  do\nsomething intended to be done by her abroad cannot  possibly\nmake the Governmental action in India either ineffective  or\nimmune from judicial scrutiny or from an attack made on\t the\nground\tof a violation of a fundamental right which  inheres\nin an Indian citizen.  The consequences or effects upon\t the\npetitioner's possible actions or future activities in  other\ncountries  may\tbe  a factor which  may\t be  weighed,  where\nrelevant, with other relevant facts in a particular case  in\njudging\t the merits of the restriction imposed.\t It will  be\nrelevant  in  so  far  as  it can  be  shown  to  have\tsome\nconnection   with   public  or\t national   interests\twhen\ndetermining the merits of an order passed.  It may show\t how\nshe has become a \" person aggrieved\" with a cause of action,\nby a particular order involving her personal freedom.\tBut,\nsuch  considerations cannot curtail or impair the  scope  or\noperation  of fundamental rights of citizens as\t protections\nagainst unjustifiable actions of their own Government.\t Nor\ncan they, by their own force, protect legally  unjustifiable\nactions of the Government of our country against attacks  in\nour own Courts.\nIn order to apply the tests contained in\nArticles 14\nand\n19\nof  the\t Constitution, we have to consider the\tobjects\t for\nwhich the exercise of inherent rights recognised by  Article\n'21  of\t the  Constitution are restricted  as  well  as\t the\nprocedure  by  which  these restrictions are  sought  to  be\nimposed.   Both substantive and procedural laws and  actions\ntaken under them will have to pass tests imposed by\narticles\n14\nand\n19\nwhenever facts justifying the invocation of either\nof  these  articles  may  be  disclosed.   For\texample,  an\ninternational singer or dancer may well be able to  complain\nof an unjustifiable restriction on professional activity  by\na denial of a passport.\t In such a case, violations of\tboth\narticles 21\nand\n19(1) (g)\nmay both be put forward making  it\nnecessary  for\tthe  authorities concerned  to\tjustify\t the\nrestriction  imposed   by showing satisfaction of  tests  of\nvalidity contemplated by each  of these two articles.\n654\nThe  tests of reason and justice cannot be  abstract.\tThey\ncannot be divorced from the needs of the nation.  The  tests\nhave  to  be pragmatic.\t Otherwise, they would cease  to  be\nreasonable.   Thus,  I think that a discretion left  to\t the\nauthority  to impound a passport in public  interest  cannot\ninvalidate the law itself.  We cannot, out of fear that such\npower  will  be\t misused,-refuse  to  permit  Parliament  to\nentrust\t even such power to executive authorities as may  be\nabsolutely necessary to carry out the purposes of a  validly\nexercisable power.  I think it has to be necessarily left to\nexecutive  discretion  to decide whether, on the  facts\t and\ncircumstances of a particular case, public interest will  or\nwill not be served by a particular order to be passed  under\na   valid  law\tsubject,  as  it  always  is,  to   judicial\nsupervision.\tIn  matters  such  as\tgrant,\t suspension,\nimpounding  or\tcancellation  of  passports,  the   possible\ndealings of an individual with nationals and authorities  of\nother  States  have to be considered.  The  contemplated  or\npossible activities abroad of the individual may have to  be\ntaken  into.  account.\tThere may be questions\tof  national\nsafety\tand  welfare which transcend the importance  of\t the\nindividual's inherent right to go where he or she pleases to\ngo.   Therefore, although we may not deny the grant of\twide\ndiscretionary  power,  to the executive authorities  as\t un-\nreasonable in such cases, yet, I think we must look for\t and\nfind procedural safeguards to ensure that the power will not\nbe  used for purposes extraneous to the grant of  the  power\nbefore\twe uphold the validity of the power  conferred.\t  We\nhave  to insist on procedural proprieties the observance  of\nwhich  could  show that such a power is being used  only  to\nserve  what  can  reasonably and justly be,  regarded  as  a\npublic\tor  national  interest\tcapable\t of  overriding\t the\nindividual's  inherent\tright  of  movement  or\t travel\t  to\nwherever  he  or she pleases in the modern world  of  closer\nintegration in every sphere between the peoples of the world\nand the shrunk time-space relationship.\nThe view I have taken above proceeds on the assumption\tthat\nthere are inherent or natural human rights of the individual\nrecognised  by\tand  embodied in  our  Constitution.   Their\nactual\texercise,  however,  is\t regulated  and\t conditioned\nlargely\t by  statutory law.  Persons upon whom\tthese  basic\nrights\tare conferred can exercise them so long as there  is\nno justifiable reason under the law enabling deprivations or\nrestrictions of such rights.  But, once the valid reason  is\nfound  to be there and the deprivation or restriction  takes\nplace for that valid reason in a procedurally valid  manner,\nthe  action  which results in a deprivation  or\t restriction\nbecomes\t unassailable.\tIf either the reason  sanctioned  by\nthe law is absent, or the procedure followed in arriving  at\nthe  conclusion that such a reason exists  is  unreasonable,\nthe  order having the effect of deprivation  or\t restriction\nmust be quashed.\nA  bare look at the provisions of S. IO, sub.s. (3 ) of\t the\nAct will show that each of the orders which could be  passed\nunder\nsection\t10\n,  sub.s.  (3)  (a)  to  (h)\trequires   a\n\"satisfaction\"\t by  the  Passport  Authority\ton   certain\nobjective  conditions which must exist in a case  before  it\npasses an order to impound a passport or a travel  document.\nImpounding or revocation are placed side by side on the same\nfooting in the provision.\nSection 11\nof the Act provides an\nappeal to the Central Government\n655\nfrom every order passed under\nsection 10\n, sub.s. (3) of\t the\nAct.   Hence,\nsection 10\n, subs. s. (5) makes  it  obligatory\nupon  the Passport Authority to \"record in writing  a  brief\nstatement  of the reasons for making such order and  furnish\nto the holder of the passport or travel document on,  demand\na  copy\t of  the  same unless  in  any\tcase,  the  passport\nauthority  is  of  the opinion that it will not\t be  in\t the\ninterests  of  the sovereignty and integrity of\t India,\t the\nsecurity  of  India, friendly relations of  India  with\t any\nforeign country or in the interests of the general public to\nfurnish such a copy\".\nIt seems to me, from the provisions of\nsection 5\n,\n7\nand\n8\nof\nthe  Act,  read\t with  other provisions,  that\tthere  is  a\nstatutory  right also acquired, on fulfilment of  prescribed\nconditions  by\tthe  holder of a passport,  that  it  should\ncontinue to be effective for the specified period so long as\nno ground has come into existence for either its  revocation\nor for impounding it which amounts to a suspension of it for\nthe  time  being.   It is true that in\ta  proceeding  under\narticle\t 32\nof the Constitution, we are only concerned\twith\nthe enforcement of fundamental Constitutional rights and not\nwith  any  statutory rights apart from\tfundamental  rights.\nArticle\t 2  1\n, however, makes it clear That violation  of  a\nlaw,  whether statutory or if any other kind, is  itself  an\ninfringement of the guaranteed fundamental right.  The basic\nright\tis  not\t to  be\t denied\t the  protection  of   \"law\"\nirrespective  of  variety of that law.\tIt need\t only  be  a\nright \"established by law\".\nThere  can  be\tno doubt whatsoever that  the  orders  under\nsection 10(3)\nmust be based upon some material even if\tthat\nmaterial  consists, in some cases, of  reasonable  suspicion\narising\t from certain credible assertions made\tby  reliable\nindividuals.  It may be that, in an emergent situation,\t the\nimpounding  of a passport may become necessary without\teven\ngiving an opportunity to be heard against such a step, which\ncould  be reversed after an opportunity given to the  holder\nof  the passport to show why the step was unnecessary,\tbut,\nordinarily, no passport could be reasonably either impounded\nor revoked without giving a prior opportunity to its  holder\nto  show cause against the proposed action.  The  impounding\nas well revocation of a passport, seem to constitute  action\nin  the\t nature of a punishment necessitated on one  of\t the\ngrounds\t specified  in\tthe  Act.   Hence,  ordinarily,\t  an\nopportunity to be heard in defence after a show cause notice\nshould\tbe  given to the holder of a, passport\teven  before\nimpounding it.\nIt is well established that even where there is no  specific\nprovision in a statute or rules made thereunder for  showing\ncause  against\taction\tproposed  to  be  taken\t against  an\nindividual, which affects the rights of that individual, the\nduty  to  give reasonable opportunity to be  heard  will  be\nimplied\t from the nature of the function to be performed  by\nthe  authority\twhich  has the power  to  take\tpunitive  or\ndamaging action.  This principle was laid down by this Court\nin the\nState of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei &  Ors.\n(1)\nin the following words\n\"The  rule that a party to whose prejudice  an\norder is intended to be passed is entitled  to\na hearing applies alike to\n(1)   AIR 1967 S.C. 1269 at 1271.\n656\njudicial\ttribunals  and\tbodies\tof   persons\ninvested\twith  authority to  adjudicate\tupon\nmatters  involving civil consequences.  It  is\none   of\t the  fundamental   rules   of\t our\nconstitutional  set-up that every\t citizen  is\nprotected\t  against  exercise   of   arbitrary\nauthority by the State or its officers.\tDuty\nto act judicially would, therefore arise\tfrom\nthe very nature of the function intended to be\nperformed,  it need not be shown to be  super-\n,added.\tIf  there  is power  to\t decide\t and\ndetermine\t to the prejudice of a person,\tduty\nto act judicially is implicit in the  exercise\nof  such power.  If the essentials of  justice\nbe ignored and an order to the prejudice of  a\nPerson is made, the order is a nullity.\tThat\nis  a  basic concept of the rule\tof  law\t and\nimportance thereof transcends the significance\nof a decision in any particular case.\"\nIn  England,  the  rule was thus expressed by  Byles  J.  in\nCooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works(1)\n\"The  laws of God and man both give the  party\nan opportunity to make his defence, if he\t has\nany.  I remember to have heard it observed  by\na\t very  learned man, upon such  an  occasion,\nthat  even God himself did not  pass  sentence\nupon  Adam before be was called upon  to\tmake\nhis  defence.   \"Adam (says God),\t \"where\t art\nthou  ?  Hast  thou ? not eaten  of  the\ttree\nwhereof  I commanded thee that thou  shouldest\nnot  eat And the same question was put to\t Eve\nalso.\"\nI find no difficulty whatsoever in holding, on the  strength\nof   these  well  recognised  principles,  that\t  an   order\nimpounding  a passport must be made quasi-judicially.\tThis\nwas not done in the case before us.\nIn  my\testimation, the findings arrived at  by\t my  learned\nbrethren  after\t an  examination of the facts  of  the\tcase\nbefore\tus, with which I concur, indicate that it cannot  be\nsaid  that a good enough reason has been shown to exist\t for\nimpounding the passport of the petitioner by the order dated\n7th  July,  1977.  Furthermore, the petitioner\thas  bad  no\nopportunity  of\t showing that the ground for  impounding  it\nfinally given in this Court either does not exist or has  no\nbearing on public interest or that public interest cannot be\nbetter served in some other manner.  Therefore, speaking for\nmyself,\t I  would quash the order and  direct  the  opposite\nparties\t to give an opportunity to the petitioner  to  show-\ncause against any proposed action on such grounds as may  be\navailable.\nI am not satisfied that there were present any such pressing\ngrounds\t with  regard to the petitioner before us  that\t the\nimmediate action of impounding her passport was called\tfor.\nFurthermore, the rather cavalier fashion in which disclosure\nof any reason for impounding her passport was denied to her,\ndespite\t the  fact that the only reason said  to  exist\t the\npossibility  of her being called to give evidence  before  a\ncommission  of inquiry and stated in  the  counter-affidavit\nfiled in this Court, is not such as to be reasonably  deemed\nto necessitate, its concealment in\n(1)  1863 (14) C.B. (N.S.) 180.\n657\npublic\tinterest, may indicate the existence of\t some  undue\nprejudice  against the petitioner.  She has to be  protected\nagainst even the appearance of such prejudice or bias.\nIt appears to me that even executive authorities when taking\nadministrative action which involves any deprivations of  or\nrestrictions on inherent fundamental rights of citizens must\ntake  care  to\tsee  that  justice  is\tnot  only  done\t but\nmanifestly appears to be done.\tThey have a duty to  proceed\nin  a  way  which  is  free  from  even\t the  appearance  of\narbitrariness or unreasonableness or unfairness.  They\thave\nto act in a manner which is patently impartial and meets the\nrequirements of natural justice.\nThe attitude adopted by the Attorney General however,  shows\nthat   Passport\t  authorities\trealize\t  fully\t  that\t the\npetitioner's  case has not been justly or  reasonably  dealt\nwith.\tAs  the undertaking given by  the  Attorney  General\namounts to an offer to deal with it justly and fairly  after\ninforming  the petitioner of any ground that may  exist\t for\nimpounding her passport, it seems that no further action  by\nthis  Court may be necessary.  In view, however, of what  is\npractically  an admission that the order actually passed  on\n7th  July, 1977, is neither fair nor procedurally proper,  I\nwould, speaking for myself, quash this order and direct\t the\nreturn of the impounded passport to the petitioner.  I\talso\nthink that the petitioner is entitled to her costs.\nCHANDRACHUD, J.-The petitioner's passport dated June 1, 1976\nhaving been impounded \"in public interest\" by an order dated\nJuly 2, 1977 and the Government of India having declined \"in\nthe  interest  of  general public\" to  furnish\tto  her\t the\nreasons. for its decision, she has filed this writ  petition\nunder\narticle\t32\nof the Constitution\t to  challenge\tthat\norder.\tThe challenge is founded on the following grounds :\n(1)   To the extent to which\nsection 10(3) (c)\nof  the  Passport\t Act,  1967  authorises\t the\npassport\tauthority to impound a passport\t \"in\nthe  interests of the general public\",  it  is\nviolative\t of\narticle 14\nof  the\tConstitution\nsince it confers vague and undefined power  on\nthe passport authority;\n(2)\nSection 10 (3) (c)\nis void as conferring\nan  arbitrary power since it does not  provide\nfor  a hearing to the holder of  the  passport\nbefore the passport is, impounded;\n(3)\nSection 10(3)(c)\nis violative of\narticle\n21\nof  the  Constitution since  it  does\t not\nprescribe\t 'procedure' within the\t meaning  of\nthat article and since the procedure which  it\nprescribes is arbitrary and unreasonable; and\n(4)\nSection   10  (3)(c)\noffends   against\narticles\t19(1)(a)\nand\n19 (1 ) (g)\nsince  it\npermits  restrictions  to be  imposed  on\t the\nrights  guaranteed  by  these  articles\teven\nthough  such  restrictions cannot\t be  imposed\nunder\narticles 19(2)\nand\n19(6).\n658\nAt first, the passport authority exercising its power  under\nsection\t 10(5)\nof  the\t Act  refused  to  furnish  to\t the\npetitioner the reason for which it was considered  necessary\nin the interests of general public to impound her  passport.\nBut  those  reasons  were disclosed later  in  the  counter-\naffidavit  filed  on behalf of the Government  of  India  in\nanswer to the writ petition.  The disclosure made under\t the\nstress\tof the writ petition that the petitioner's  passport\nwas  impounded\tbecause,  her  presence\t was  likely  to  be\nrequired  in  connection  with\tthe  proceedings  before   a\nCommission of Inquiry, could easily have been made when\t the\npetitioner  called upon the Government to let her  know\t the\nreasons why her passport was impounded.\t The power to refuse\nto  disclose the reasons for impounding a passport is of  an\nexceptional  nature  and it ought to  be  exercised  fairly,\nsparingly and only when fully justified by the exigencies of\nan uncommon situation.\tThe reasons, if disclosed being open\nto  judicial scrutiny for ascertaining their nexus with\t the\norder  impounding the passport, the refusal to disclose\t the\nreasons would equally be open to the scrutiny of the  court;\nor  else,  the wholesome power of a  dispassionate  judicial\nexamination  of executive orders could with impunity be\t set\nat  naught  by\tan obdurate determination  to  suppress\t the\nreasons.  Law cannot permit the exercise of a power to\tkeep\nthe  reasons undisclosed if the sole reason for doing so  is\nto keep the reasons away from judicial scrutiny.\nIn\nSatwant  Singh  Sawhney  v.\t D.  Ramarathnam,  Assistant\nPassport  Officer, Government of India, New Delhi &  Ors.\n(1)\nthis  Court ruled by majority that the expression  \"personal\nliberty\"  which\t occurs in\narticle 21\nof  the\tConstitution\nincludes  the right to travel abroad and that no person\t can\nbe  deprived  of that right except  according  to  procedure\nestablished  by law.\nThe Passport Act\nwhich was enacted  by\nParliament  in\t1967 in order to comply with  that  decision\nprescribes  the\t procedure  whereby  an\t application  for  a\npassport may be granted fully or partially, with or  without\nany  endorsement, and a passport once granted may  later  be\nrevoked\t or  impounded.\t But the mere prescription  of\tsome\nkind  of procedure cannot ever meet the mandate\t of  article\n21.   The procedure prescribed by law has to be\t fair,\tjust\nand reasonable, not fanciful, oppressive or arbitrary.\t The\nquestion  whether  the procedure prescribed by a  law  which\ncurtails  or takes away the personal liberty  guaranteed  by\narticle 21\nis reasonable or not has to be considered not  in\nthe  abstract  or on hypothetical  considerations  like\t the\nprovision  for\ta  full-dressed hearing as  in\ta  Courtroom\ntrial,\tbut in the context, primarily, of the purpose  which\nthe  Act  is intended to achieve and  of  urgent  situations\nwhich  those who are charged with the duty of  administering\nthe Act may be called upon to deal with.  Secondly, even the\nfullest\t compliance with the requirements of\narticle  21\nis\nnot  the journey's end because, a law which prescribes\tfair\nand  reasonable procedure for curtailing or taking away\t the\npersonal liberty guaranteed by\narticle 21\nhas still to\tmeet\na   possible  challenge\t under\tother  Provisions   of\t the\nConstitution like, for example,\narticles 14\nand\n19.\nIf\t the\nholding\t in\nA. K. Gopalan v. State of\tMadras\n(2)  that\t the\nfreedoms guaranteed by the Constitution are\n(1)  [1967] 3 SCR 525\n(2)  [1950] SCR 88.\n659\nmutually exclusive were still good law, the right to  travel\nabroad which is part of the right of personal liberty  under\narticle\t 21\ncould only be found and located in that  article\nand  in no other.  But in the\nBank Nationalisation\nCase\t (R.\nC. Cooper v. Union of India) (1) the majority held that\t the\nassumption in A. K. Gopalan(2) that certain articles of\t the\nConstitution  exclusively deal with specific matters  cannot\nbe  accepted  as correct.\nThough the  Bank  Nationalisation\ncase(1) was concerned with the inter-relationship of\narticle\n31\nand\n19\nand not ,of\narticles 21\nand\n19\n, the basic approach\nadopted\t therein as regards the construction of\t fundamental\nrights\tguaranteed  in\tthe  different\tpro-visions  of\t the\nConstitution  categorically discarded the major\t premise  of\nthe majority judgment in\nA. K. Gopalan\n(supra) as incorrect.\nThat  is how a seven-Judge Bench in\nShambhu Nath  Sarkar  v.\nState  of West Bengal & Ors.\n(3) assessed the true impact  of\nthe  ratio of the\nBank Nationalisation\nCase (supra)  on\t the\ndecision in\nA. K. Gopalan\n(supra) in Shambhu Nath  Sarkar(3)\nit was accordingly held that a law of preventive  detention\nhas to meet the challenge not only of\narticles 21\nand\n22\nbut\nalso  of\narticle 19 (1 ) (d).\nLater, a five-Judge Bench  in\nHaradhan Saha v. State of West Bengal & Ors.\n(4) adopted\t the\nsame  approach\tand  considered\t the  question\twhether\t the\nMaintenance  of\t Internal Security Act,\t 1971\nviolated\t the\nright  guaranteed by\narticle 19(1) (d).\nThus,\tthe  inquiry\nwhether\t the right to travel abroad forms a part of any\t of\nthe  freedoms mentioned in\narticle 19(1)\nis not to  be\tshut\nout at the threshold merely because that right is a part  of\nthe guarantee of personal liberty under\narticle 21.\n1 am  in\nentire agreement with Brother Bhagwati when he says :\n\"The  law must, therefore, now be taken to  be\nwell settled that\narticle 21\ndoes not  exclude\narticle 19\nand that even if there is  a  law\nprescribing a procedure for depriving a\nperson  of  'personal liberty'  and  there  is\nconsequently    no   infringement\t   of\t the\nfundamental  right  conferred by\narticle\t 21\n,\nsuch  law, in so far as it abridges  or  takes\naway  any fundamental right under\narticle  19\nwould  have  to  meet the\t challenge  of\tthat\narticle.\"\nThe  interplay of  diverse articles  of\t the  Constitution\nguaranteeing various freedoms has gone through\tvicissitudes\nwhich have been elaborately traced by Brother Bhagwati.\t The\ntest  of directness of the impugned law as  contrasted\twith\nits  consequences was thought in\nA. K. Gopalan\n(supra)\t and\nRam Singh(5) to be the true approach for determining whether\na   fundamental\t  right\t was   infringed.    A\t significant\napplication  of\t that  test may be perceived  in  Naresh  S.\nMirajkar(6)  where an order passed by the Bombay High  Court\nprohibiting  the  publication of a witness's evidence  in  a\ndefamation case was upheld by this Court on the ground\tthat\nit was passed with the object of affording protection to the\nwitness in order to obtain true evidence\n(1)  [1973] 3 SCR 530.\n(2)  [1950] SCR 88\n(3)  [1973] 1 SCR 856.\n(4)  [1975] 1 SCR 778.\n(5)  [1951] SCR 451.\n(6)  [1966] 3 SCR 744.\n660\nand  its impact on the right of free speech  and  expression\nguaranteed  by\narticle\t 19(1) (a)\nwas\tincidental.   N.  H.\nBhagwati J. in Express Newspapers(1) struck a modified\tnote\nby  evolving the test of proximate effect and  operation  of\nthe statute.  That test saw its fruition in Sakal  Papers(2)\nwhere  the  Court,  giving  precedence\tto  the\t direct\t and\nimmediate  effect  of the order over its  form\tand  object,\nstruck\tdown  the Daily Newspapers (Price and  Page)  Order,\n1960 on the ground that it violated\narticle 19(1)(a)\nof\t the\nConstitution.  The culmination of this thought process\tcame\nin  the\nBank Nationalisation\nCase (supra) where it was\theld\nby  the majority, speaking through Shah J., that the  extent\nof  protection against impairment of a fundamental right  is\ndetermined  by\tthe direct operation of an action  upon\t the\nindividual's rights and not by the object of the legislature\nor  by\tthe form of the action.\t In Bennett  Coleman(3)\t the\nCourt, by a majority, reiterated   the\t same  position\t  by\nsaying that the direct operation of the Act upon the  rights\nforms  the real test.  It struck down the newsprint  policy,\nrestricting  the number of pages of newspapers\twithout\t the\noption\tto reduce the circulation, as offending against\t the\nprovisions  of\narticle 19(1) (a).\n\"The action may  have  a\ndirect\teffect\ton a fundamental right although\t its  direct\nsubject matter may be different\" observed the Court,  citing\nan  effective instance of a law dealing with the Defence  of\nIndia  or with defamation and yet having a direct effect  on\nthe  freedom  of  speech and  expression.   The\t measure  of\ndirectness, as held by Brother Bhagwati, is the 'inevitable'\nconsequence  of\t the impugned statute.\tThese then  are\t the\nguidelines  with  the  help of which one  has  to  ascertain\nwhether\nsection  10(3)\t (c)\nof  the  Passport\t Act   which\nauthorizes  the passport authority to impound a passport  or\nthe impugned   order   passed\tthereunder   violates\t the\nguarantee of free speech and expression conferred by\narticle\n19(1) (a).\nThe learned Attorney General answered the  petitioner's\ncontention in this behalf by saying firstly, that the  right\nto  go abroad\tcannot be comprehended within the  right  of\nfree speech and expression since the   latter\tright\tis\nexercisable  by the Indian citizens within the\tgeographical\nlimits of India only. Secondly, he contends, the right to go\nabroad is altogether of a different genre from the right  of\nfree  speech and expression and is therefore not a  part  of\nit.\nThe  first  of these contentions raises a  question  of\ngreat  importance  but the form in which the  contention  is\ncouched\t is,  in my opinion, apt to befog  the\ttrue  issue.\nArticle\t 19\nconfers certain freedoms oil  Indian  citizens,\nsome of which by their very language and nature are  limited\nin their exercise by geographical considerations. The  right\nto move freely throughout the 'territory of India' and the\nright to reside and settle in any part of the 'territory  of\nIndia' which are contained in clauses (d) and (e) of\narticle\n19(1)\nare of this nature. The two clauses expressly restrict\nthe  operation\tof  the\t rights\t mentioned  therein  to\t the\nterritorial limits of India. Besides, by the very object and\nnature of those rights, their exercise is limited to  Indian\nterritory.\n(1)  [1959] SCR 12.\n(2)  [1962] 3 SCR 842.\n(3)  [1973] 2 SCR 757.\n661\nThose rights are intended to bring in sharp focus, the unity\nand   integrity\t of  the  country  and\t its   quasi-federal\nstructure.  Their drive is directed against the\t fissiparous\ntheory\tthat  'sons  of the soil' alone\t shall\tthrive,\t the\n'soil' being conditioned by regional and sub-regional consi-\nderations.   The other freedoms which\narticle 19(1)\nconfers\nare  not so restricted by their terms but that again is\t not\nconclusive, of the question under consideration.  Nor indeed\ndoes the fact that restraints on the freedoms guaranteed  by\nArticle\t 19(1)\ncan be imposed under\nArticles 19(2)\nto  19(6)\nby  the State furnish any clue to that question.  The  State\ncan   undoubtedly   impose   reasonable\t  restrictions\t  on\nfundamental freedoms under clauses (2) to (6) of\nArticle  19\nand  those  restrictions,  generally,  have  a\t territorial\noperation.  But the ambit of a freedom cannot be measured by\nthe  right of a State to pass laws imposing restrictions  on\nthat  freedom  which,  in the generality of  cases,  have  a\ngeographical limitation.\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nguarantees to Indian citizens the right to\nfreedom of speech and expression.  It does not delimit\tthat\nright  in any manner and there is no reason, arising  either\nout of interpretational dogmas or pragmatic  considerations,\nwhy the courts should strain the language of the Article  to\ncut down the amplitude of that right.  The plain meaning  of\nthe  clause guaranteeing free speech and expression is\tthat\nIndian citizens are entitled to exercise that right wherever\nthey  choose,  regardless  of  geographical  considerations,\nsubject\t of course to the operation of any existing  law  or\nthe  power  of the State to make a law\timposing  reasonable\nrestrictions  in  the  interests  of  the  sovereignty\t and\nintegrity  of  India, the security of  the  State,  friendly\nrelations  with\t foreign States, public\t order,\t decency  or\nmorality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or\nincitement to an offence, as provided in\narticle 19(2).\nThe\nexercise  of the right of free speech and expression  beyond\nthe  limits  of Indian territory will, of  course,  also  be\nsubject\t to the laws of the country in which the freedom  is\nor  is intended to be exercised.  I am quite clear that\t the\nConstitution  does not confer any power on the executive  to\nprevent\t the exercise by an Indian citizen of the  right  of\nfree speech and expression on foreign soil, subject to\twhat\nI  have\t just stated.  In fact, that seems to me to  be\t the\ncrux  of  the matter, for which reason I said,\tthough\twith\nrespect, that the form in which the learned Attorney General\nstated\this proposition was likely to cloud the true  issue.\nThe Constitution guarantees certain fundamental freedoms and\nexcept\twhere  their  exercise\tis  limited  by\t territorial\nconsiderations, those freedoms may be exercised\t wheresoever\none  chooses,  subject to the exceptions  or  qualifications\nmentioned above.\nThe next question is whether the right to go out of India is\nan integral part of the right of free speech and  expression\nand is comprehended within it.\tIt seems to me impossible to\nanswer\tthis question in the affirmative as is contended  by\nthe petitioner's counsel, Shri Madan Bhatia.  It is possible\nto  predicate  of many a right that its exercise  would\t be\nmore meaningful if the right is extended to comprehended  an\nextraneous  facility.  But such extensions do not form\tpart\nof the right conferred by the Constitution.  The analogy  of\nthe  freedom  of press being included in the right  of\tfree\nspeech and expression\n4-119SCI/78\n662\nis  wholly  misplaced because the right of  free  expression\nincontrovertibly includes the right of freedom of the press.\nThe  right to, go abroad on one hand and the right  of\tfree\nspeech and expression on the other are made up of  basically\ndifferent constituents, so different indeed that one  cannot\nbe comprehended in the other.\nBrother\t Bhagwati has, on this aspect considered  at  length\ncertain\t American  decisions like  Kent(1),_Apthekar(2)\t and\nZemel(3)  and  illuminating  though his analysis  is,  I  am\ninclined  to  think  that the presence of  the\tdue  process\nclause\tin  the\t 5th and 14th  Amendments  of  the  American\nConstitution makes significant difference to the approach of\nAmerican   Judges  to  the  definition\tand  evaluation\t  of\nconstitutional\tguarantees.   The  content  which  has\tbeen\nmeaningfully  and imaginatively poured into \"due process  of\nlaw\"  may,  in\tmy view, constitute an\timportant  point  of\ndistinction between the American Constitution and ours which\nstudiously avoided the use of that expression.\tIn the\tCen-\ntennial\t Volume.   \"The\t Fourteenth  Amendment\"\t edited\t  by\nBernard\t Schwartz, is contained in an article on  'Landmarks\nof Legal Liberty' by Justice William J. Brennan in which the\nlearned Judge quoting from Yeat's play has this to say :  In\nthe service of the ageold dream for recognition of the equal\nand inalienable rights of man, the 14th Amendment though 100\nyears old, can never be old.\n\"Like the poor old women in Yeat's play,\n\"Did  you\t see  an old woman  going  down\t the\npath?\"  asked Bridget.  \"I did  not,\"  replied\nPatrick, who had come into the house after the\nold  woman left it, \"But I saw a young  girl\nand she had the walk of a queen.\"\nOur  Constitution too strides in its majesty but, may it  be\nremembered,  without the due process clause, I prefer to  be\ncontent\t with a decision directly in point, All\t India\tBank\nEmployees'  Association(4) In which this Court rejected\t the\ncontention  that the freedom to form associations or  unions\ncontained  in\narticle 19 (1 ) (c)\ncarried with it the  right\nthat  a\t workers' union could do all that was  necessary  to\nmake  that right effective, in order to achieve the  purpose\nfor  which  the\t union was formed.   One  right\t leading  to\nanother\t and  that another to still other, and\tso  on,\t was\ndescribed in the abovementioned decision as productive of  a\n\"grotesque result\".\nI have nothing more to add to what Brother Bhagwati has said\non  the other points in the case.  I share his opinion\tthat\nthough\tthe right to go abroad is not included in the  right\ncontained  in\narticle\t19(1)(a)\n, if  an  order\t made  under\nsection 10(3)(c)\nof the Act does in fact violate, the  right\nof free speech and expression, such an order could be struck\ndown as unconstitutional.  It is well-settled that a statute\nmay  pass  the test of constitutionality and  yet  an  order\npassed under it may be unconstitutional.  But of that I will\nsay no more\n(1)  2 L. ed. 2d 1204.\n(2)  12 L. ed. 2d 992.\n(3)  14 L. ed. 2d 179.\n(4)  [1962] 3 SCR 269.\n663\nbecause\t in  this branch, one says no more  than  the  facts\nwarrant\t and  decides  nothing\tthat does  not\tcall  for  a\ndecision.  The fact that the petitioner was not heard before\nor  soon  after the impounding of her  passport\t would\thave\nintroduced  a  serious infirmity in the order  but  for\t the\nstatement of the Attorney General that the.  Government was,\nwilling\t to  hear the petitioner and further  to  limit\t the\noperation  of the order to a period of six months  from\t the\ndate  of the fresh decision, if the decision was adverse  to\nthe petitioner.\t The order, I agree, does not in fact offend\nagainst\narticle 19 (1) (a)\nor 19 (1) (g).\n1,  therefore,\tagree  with the order  proposed\t by  Brother\nBhagwati.\nBHAGWATI,  J.-The Petitioner is the holder of  the  passport\nissued\tto  her on 1st June, 1976 under\t the\nPassport\tAct,\n1967\n.\tOn 4th July, 1977 the Petitioner received  a  letter\ndated  2nd  July, 1977 from the Regional  Passport  Officer,\nDelhi  intimating  to her that it has been  decided  by\t the\nGovernment  of India to impound her passport  under\nsection\n10(3)(c)\nof the Act in public interest and requiring her  to\nsurrender  the passport within seven days from the  date  of\nreceipt of the letter.\tThe petitioner immediately addressed\na letter to the Regional Passport Officer requesting him  to\nfurnish\t a copy of the statement of reasons for\t making\t the\norder as provided in\nsection 10(5)\nto which a reply was sent\nby the Government of India, Ministry of External Affairs  on\n6th  July, 1977 stating inter alia that the  Government\t has\ndecided\t \"in  the  interest of the general  public\"  not  to\nfurnish\t her a copy of the statement of reasons, for  making\nof  the order.\tThe Petitioner thereupon filed\tthe  present\npetition  challenging  the  action  of\tthe  Government\t  in\nimpounding  her passport and declining to give\treasons\t for\ndoing  so.  The action of the Government was impugned  inter\nalia on the ground that it was mala fide, but this challenge\nwas not pressed before us at the time of the hearing of\t the\narguments  and hence it is not necessary to state any  facts\nhearing\t on that question.  The principal challenge set\t out\nin  the petition against the legality of the action  of\t the\nGovernment was based mainly on the ground that\nsection 10(3)\n(c),  in  so far as it empowers the Passport  Authority\t to'\nimpound a passport \"in the interests of the general  public\"\nis violative of the equality clause contained in\nArt. 14\nof\nthe  Constitution, since the condition denoted by the  words\n\"in  the  interests  of the  general  public\"  limiting\t the\nexercise  of the power is vague and undefined and the  power\nconferred  by  this provision is, therefore,  excessive\t and\nsuffers\t from the vice of \"over-breath.\" The, petition\talso\ncontained a challenge that an order under\nsection 10(3)\t (c)\nimpounding  a  passport could not be made  by  the  Passport\nAuthority without giving an opportunity to the holder of the\npassportto be heard in defence and since   in the  present\ncase, the passport  was impounded    by\t  the\t Government\nwithout affording an apportunity of  hearingto\t\tthe\npetitioner, the order\t was  null  and\t void,\tand  in\t the\nalternativeif\nsection\t10(3) (c)\nwere\tread in\t such  a\nmanner as to exclude the  right of hearing, the\t section\nwould be infected with the vice ofarbitrariness\t  and\t it\nwould be void as  offending\nArticle 14.\nThese were the only\ngrounds\t taken\tin the Petition as originally filed  and  on\n20th July, 1977 the petition was admitted and rule issued by\nthis Court and an interim order was made directing\n664\nthat  the  passport  of the petitioner\tshould\tcontinue  to\nremain\tdeposited with the Registrar of this  Court  pending\nthe hearing and final disposal of the Petition.\nThe  hearing of the petition was fixed on 30th August  1977,\nbut  before  that, the petitioner filed an  application\t for\nurging\tadditional  grounds  and by  this  application,\t two\nfurther grounds were sought to be urged by her.\t One  ground\nwas that\nsection 10(3)(c)\nis ultra vires\nArticle 21\nsince it\nprovides for impounding of passport without any procedure as\nrequired by that Article, or, in any event, even if it could\nbe  said that there is some procedure prescribed  under\t the\npassport Act, 1967, it is wholly arbitrary and\tunreasonable\nand,  therefore, not in compliance with the  requirement  of\nthat  article.\t The  other ground urged on  behalf  of\t the\npetitioner  was\t that\nsection\t10(3)(c)\nis  violative\t  of\nArticles  19(1)(a)\nand\n19(1)(g)\ninasmuch as  it  authorises\nimposition   of\t restrictions  on  freedom  of\tSpeech\t and\nexpression guaranteed under\nArticle 19 (1 ) (a)\nand freedom\nto practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, or\nbusiness  guaranteed under\nArticle  19(1)(g)\nand   these\nrestrictions  are  impermissible  under\nArticle  19(2)\nand\nArticle\t 19(6)\nrespectively.  The  application\t for  urging\nthese  two additional grounds was granted by this Court\t and\nultimately at the hearing of the petition these were the two\nprincipal  grounds  which  were pressed\t on  behalf  of\t the\npetitioner.\nBefore we examine the rival arguments urged on behalf of the\nparties\t in regard to the various questions arising in\tthis\npetition,  it  would be convenient to set out  the  relevant\nprovisions of the\nPassport Act, 1967\n.\nThis Act\nwas  enacted\non 24th June, 1967 in view of the decision of this Court  in\nSatwant Singh Sawhney v. D. Ramarathnam, Assistant  Passport\nOfficer\n.   Government  of  India, New Delhi  &\tOrs.(1)\t The\nposition  which obtained prior to the coming into  force  of\nthis  Act was that there was no law regulating the issue  of\npassports for leaving the shores of India and going  abroad.\nThe issue of passports was entirely within the discretion of\nthe   executive\t and  this  discretion\twas   unguided\t and\nunchannelled.\tThis  Court, by a majority,  bela  that\t the\nexpression  \"personal  liberty\" in\nArticle 21\ntakes  in\t the\nright  of locomotion and travel abroad and under\nArticle  21\nno  person can be deprived of his right to go abroad  except\naccording  to the procedure established by law and since  no\nlaw had been made by the State regulating or prohibiting the\nexercise  of  such  right, the refusal of  passport  was  in\nviolation of\nArticle 21\nand moreover the discretion with the\nexecutive  in  the matter of issuing  or  refusing  passport\nbeing  unchannelled and arbitrary, it was plainly  violative\nof\nArticle 14\nand hence the order refusing passport to\t the\npetitioner  was\t also  invalid\tunder  that  Article.\tThis\ndecision  was  accepted\t by  Parliament\t and  the  infirmity\npointed\t out  by it was set right by the  enactment  of\t the\nPassports  Act, 1967\n.\nThis Act\n, as its preamble shows,\t was\nenacted\t to  provide for the issue of passports\t and  travel\ndocuments  to regulate the departure from India of  citizens\nof India and other persons and for incidental and  ancillary\nmatters.\nSection  3\nprovides that no person  shall  depart\nfrom or attempt to depart from India unless be holds in\n(1)  [1967] 3 SCR525.\n665\nthis  behalf a valid passport or travel document.  What\t are\nthe  different\tclasses of passports  and  travel  documents\nwhich can be issued under the Act is\nlaid down in\nsection 4\n.\nSection\t 5\n,  sub-section  (1)  provides\t for  making  of  an\napplication  for issue of a passport or travel\tdocument  or\nfor  endorsement  on such passport or  travel  document\t for\nvisiting  foreign country or countries and  sub-section\t (2)\nsays  that  on\treceipt of such\t application,  the  passport\nauthority,  after  making such inquiry, if any,\t as  it\t may\nconsider  necessary,  shall, by order in writing,  issue  or\nrefuse\tto issue the passport or travel document or make  or\nrefuse\t to  make  on  the  passport  or   travel   document\nendorsement  in\t respect  of. one or  more  of\tthe  foreign\ncountries  specified  in the application.   Sub-section\t (3)\nrequires  the passport authority, where it refuses to  issue\nthe  passport or travel document or to make any\t endorsement\non  the passport or travel document, to record in writing  a\nbrief  statement  of  its reasons  for\tmaking\tsuch  order.\nSection\t 6\n, sub-section (1) lays down the grounds  on  which\nthe  passport authority shall refuse to make an\t endorsement\nfor  visiting  any foreign country and provides that  on  no\nother  ground the endorsement shall be refused.\t  There\t are\nfoul  grounds set out in this sub-section and of  them,\t the\nlast is that, in the opinion of the Central Government,\t the\npresence of the applicant in such foreign country is not  in\nthe public interest.  Similarly sub-section (2) of\nsection 6\nspecifies the grounds on which alone and on no other grounds\nthe  passport  authority shall refuse to issue\tpassport  of\ntravel document for visiting any foreign country and amongst\nvarious\t grounds  set out there, the last is  that,  in\t the\nopinion\t of the Central Government the issue of passport  or\ntravel\tdocument to the applicant will not be in the  public\ninterest.  Then we come to\nsection 10\nwhich is the  material\nsection\t which falls for consideration.\t Sub-section (1)  of\nthat  section  empowers the passport authority\tto  vary  or\ncancel\tthe endorsement of a passport or travel document  or\nto  vary  or  cancel  the conditions  subject  to  which a\npassport or travel document has been issued, having  regard,\ninter alia, to the provisions of sub-section (1) of\nsection\n6\nor  any notification. under\nsection 19\n,  Sub-section\t (2)\nconfers\t powers on the passport authority to vary or  cancel\nthe  conditions\t of  the  passport  or\ttravel\tdocument  on\napplication of the holder of the passport or travel document\nand  with the previous approval of the\tCentral\t Government.\nSub-section  (3)  provides that the passport  authority\t may\nimpound\t or  cause to be impounded or revoke a\tpassport  or\ntravel\tdocument  on the grounds set out in clauses  (a)  to\n(h),  The order impounding the passport in the present\tcase\nwas  made by the Central Government under clause  (c)  which\nreads as follows:--\n\"(c)  if\tthe  passport  authority  deems\t  it\nnecessary\t so  to do in the  interest  of\t the\nSovereignty   and\t Integrity  of\tIndia,\t the\nsecurity of India, friendly relations of India\nwith any foreign country, or in the  interests\nof the general public;\"\nThe  particular ground relied upon for making the order\t was\nthat  set out in the last part of clause (c),  namely,\tthat\nthe  Central  Government deems it necessary to\timpound\t the\npassport  \"in  the interests of the  general  public.\"\tThen\nfollows sub-section (5) which requires the\n666\npassport  authority  impounding or revoking  a\tpassport  or\ntravel document or varying or canceling an endorsement\tmade\nupon  it  to  \"record in writing a brief  statement  of\t the\nreasons\t for making such order and furnish to the holder  of\nthe passport or travel document on demand a copy of the same\nunless,\t in  any  case, the passport  authority\t is  of\t the\nopinion\t that  it  will\t not be\t in  the  interests  of\t the\nsoveriegnty  and integrity of India, the security of  India,\nfriendly  relations of India with my foreign country  or  in\nthe interests of the general public to furnish such a copy.\"\nIt  was in virtue of the provision contained in\t the  latter\npart  of  this\tsub-section  that  the\tCentral\t  Government\ndeclined  to furnish a copy of the statement of reasons\t for\nimpounding the passport of the petitioner on the ground that\nit was not in the interests of the general public to furnish\nsuch  copy  to\tthe petitioner.\t It is indeed  a  matter  of\nregret that the Central Government should have taken up this\nattitude  in  reply to the request of the petitioner  to  be\nsupplied  a  copy  of  the  statement  of  reasons,  because\nultimately, when the petition came to be filed, the  Central\nGovernment  did\t disclose the reasons in  the  affidavit  in\nreply  to  the petition which shows that it was\t not  really\ncontrary  to public interest and if we look at\tthe  reasons\ngiven  in the affidavit in reply, it will be clear  that  no\nreasonable  person could possibly have taken the  view\tthat\nthe  interests of the general public would be prejudiced  by\nthe disclosure of the reasons.\tThis is an instance  showing\nhow power conferred on a statutory authority to act in\tthe,\ninterests of the general public can sometimes be  improperly\nexercised.   If the petitioner had not filed  the  petition,\nshe would perhaps never have been able to find out what were\nthe reasons for which her passport was impounded and she was\ndeprived of her right to go abroad.  The necessity of giving\nreasons has obviously been introduced in sub-section (5)  so\nthat  it may act as a healthy check against abuse or  misuse\nof  power.  If the reasons given are not relevant and  there\nis no nexus between the reasons and the ground on which\t the\npassport has been impounded, it would be open to the  holder\nof  the passport to challenge the order impounding it  in  a\ncourt of law and if the court is satisfied that the  reasons\nare extraneous or irrelvant, the court would strike down the\norder.\t This liability to be exposed to  judicial  scrutiny\nwould by itself act as a safeguard against improper or\tmala\nfide exercise of power.\t The court would, therefore, be very\nslow  to  accept, without close scrutiny, the claim  of\t the\npassport authority that it would not be in the interests  of\nthe  general public to disclose the reasons.   The  passport\nauthority would have to satisfy the court by placing  proper\nmaterial  that\tthe giving of reasons would be\tclearly\t and\nindubitably against the interests of the general public\t and\nif the Court is not so satisfied, the Court may require\t the\npassport  authority to disclose the reasons, subject to\t any\nvalid and lawful claim for privilege which may be set up  on\nbehalf\tof the Government.  Here in the present case, as  we\nhave  already  pointed\tout,  the  Central  Government\t did\ninitially  claim that it would be against the  interests  of\nthe  general public to disclose the reasons  for  impounding\nthe  passport, but when it, came to filing the affidavit  in\nreply,\tthe Central Government very properly abandoned\tthis\nunsustainable  claim and disclosed the reasons The  question\nwhether\t these reasons have any nexus with the interests  of\nthe general public or they are extraneous and irrelevant  is\na matter\n667\nwhich  we shall examine when we deal with the  arguments  of\nthe parties, ,Meanwhile, proceeding further with the  resume\nof the relevant provisions, reference may be made to\nsection\n11\nwhich provides for an appeal inter alia against the order\nimpounding  or revoking a passport or travel document  under\nsub-section  (3) of\nsection 10\n.\t But there is a\t proviso  to\nthis  section  which says that if the  order  impounding  or\nrevoking  a  passport or travel document is  passed  by\t the\nCentral\t Government,  there  shall be no  right\t to  appeal.\nThese are the relevant provisions of the Act in the light of\nwhich  we  have to consider the\t constitutionality  of\tsub-\nsection (3) (c) of\nsection 10\nand the validity of the  order\nimpounding the passport of the petitioner.\nMeaning and content of personal liberty in\narticle 21\nThe  first contention urged on behalf of the  petitioner  in\nsupport\t of the petition was that the right to go abroad  is\npart  of  'personal  liberty  within  the  meaning  of\tthat\nexpression as used in\nArticle 21\nand no one can. be deprived\nof  this right except according to the procedure  prescribed\nby  law.  There is no procedure prescribed by  the\nPassport\nAct, 1967\nfor impounding or revoking a passport and  thereby\npreventing the holder of the passport from going abroad\t and\nin  any event, even if some procedure can be traced  in\t the\nrelevant  provisions of the Act, it  is\t unreasonable  and\narbitrary,  inasmuch  as it does not provide for  giving  an\nopportunity  to\t the  holder of the  passport  to  be  heard\nagainst the making of the order and hence the action of\t the\ncentral\t Government  in\t impounding  the  passport  of\t the\npetitioner  is in violation of\nArticle 21.\nThis  contention\nof  the\t petitioner  raises  a\tquestion  as  to  the\ttrue\ninterpretation of\nArticle 21\n, what is the nature and  extent\nof  the\t protection afforded by this article ? What  is\t the\nmeaning of 'personal liberty' : does it include the right to\ngo  abroad  so that this right cannot be abridged  or  taken\naway  except in accordance with the procedure prescribed  by\nlaw ? What is the inter-relation between\nArt. 14\nand\nArticle\n21 ?\nDoes\nArticle 21\nmerely require that there Must be\tsome\nsemblance  of  procedure, howsoever arbitrary  or  fanciful,\nprescribed  by\tlaw before a person can be deprived  of\t his\npersonal liberty or that the procedure must satisfy  certain\nrequisites in the sense that it must be fair and  reasonable\n?\nArticle 21\noccurs in Part III of the\t Constitution  which\nconfers\t certain  fundamental  rights.\t These\t fundamental\nrights had their roots deep in the struggle for independence\nand,  as  pointed  out by Granville Austin  in\t'The  Indian\nConstitution-Cornerstone  of a Nation', \"they were  included\nin the Constitution in the hope and expectation that one day\nthe  tree of true liberty would bloom in India\".  They\twere\nindelibly  written in the sub-conscious memory of  the\trace\nwhich fought for well-nigh thirty years for securing freedom\nfrom  British rule and they found expression in the form  of\nfundamental rights when the Constitution was enacted.  These\nfundamental  rights represent the basic values cherished  by\nthe  people of this country since the Vedic times  and\tthey\nare calculated to protect the dignity of the individual\t and\ncreate conditions in which every human being can develop his\npersonality to the fullest extent.  They weave a \"pattern of\nguarantees  on\tthe  basic-structure of\t human\trights\"\t and\nimpose negative obligations on the State not to encroach  on\nindi-\n668\nvidual\tliberty in its various dimensions.  It\tis  apparent\nfrom  the enunciation of these rights that the, respect\t for\nthe  individual\t and his capacity  for\tindividual  volition\nwhich  finds  expression  there is  not\t a  self  fulfilling\nprophecy.  Its purpose is to help the individual to find his\nown  liability, to give expression to his creativity and  to\nprevent governmental and other forces from 'alienating'\t the\nindividual  from  his creative impulses.  These\t rights\t are\nwide  ranging  and comprehensive and they fall\tunder  seven\nheads,\tnamely, right to equality, right to  freedom,  right\nagainst exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural\nand  educational  rights,  right to property  and  right  to\nconstitutional remedies.\nArticles 14\nto 18 occur under\t the\nheading\t 'Right to, Equality', and of them, by far the\tmost\nimportant is\nArticle 14\nwhich confers a fundamental right by\ninjuncting  the\t State not to \"deny to any  person  equality\nbefore\tthe law or the equal protection of the\tlaws  within\nthe  territory\tof India\".\nArticles 19\nto  22,\t which\tfind\nplace  under  the  heading \"Right  to  freedom\tprovide\t for\ndifferent  aspects  of freedom.\t Clause (1)  of\nArticle  19\nenshrines  what\t may  be described as  the  seven  lamps  of\nfreedom.   It  provides\t that all citizens  shall  have\t the\nright-(a)  to  freedom\tof speech  and\texpression;  (b)  to\nassemble   peaceably   and  without  arms;   (c)   to\tform\nassociations  or unions; (d) to move freely  throughout\t the\nterritory of India; (e) to reside and settle in any part  of\nthe territory of India; (f) to acquire, hold and dispose  of\nproperty  and (g) to practise any profession or to carry  on\nany occupation, trade or business,.  But these freedoms\t are\nnot  and cannot be absolute, for absolute  and\tunrestricted\nfreedom of one may be destructive of the freedom of  another\nand  in a well-ordered, civilised society, freedom can\tonly\nbe regulated freedom.  Therefore, clauses (2) to (6) of\nArt.\n19\npermit  reasonable\trestrictions to be  imposed  on\t the\nexercise   of  the  fundamental\t rights\t  guaranteed   under\nclause'(1)  of that article.\nArticle 20\nneed not detain  us\nas,  that  is  not material for\t the  determination  of\t the\ncontroversy  between  the parties.  Then  comes\nArticle  21\nwhich provides :\n\"21.  No person shall be deprived of his\tlife\nor   personal  liberty  except  according\t  to\nprocedure established by law.\"\nArticle\t 22\nconfers protection against arrest and  detention\nin certain cases and provides inter alia safeguards in\tcase\nof  preventive detention.  The other fundamental rights\t are\nnot  relevant  to, the present discussion and we,  need\t not\nrefer to them.\nIt  is obvious that\nArticle 21\n, though couched\tin  negative\nlanguage, confers the fundamental right to life and personal\nliberty.   So  far  as\tthe right  to  personal\t liberty  is\nconcerned,  it is ensured by providing that no one shall  be\ndeprived  of personal liberty except according to  procedure\nprescribed by law.  The first question that arises for\tcon-\nsideration  on the language of\nArticle 21\nis : what  is\t the\nmeaning and content of the words 'personal liberty' as\tused\nin  this  article  ? This question incidently  came  up\t for\ndiscussion  in\tsome of the judgments in\nA.  K.\t Gopalan  v.\nState  of Madras\n(1) and the observations made  by  Patanjali\nSastri,\t J.,  Mukherjee, J., and S. R. Das,  J.,  seemed  to\nplace  a  narrow  interpretation  on  the  words   'personal\nliberty' so as to confine\n(1)  [1950] S.C.R. 88.\n669\nthe  protection\t of\nArticle 21\nto  freedom  of\t the  person\nagainst\t unlawful  detention.\tBut there  was\tno  definite\npronouncement  made on this point since the question  before\nthe  Court was not so much the interpretation of  the  words\n'personal liberty' as the inter-relation between\nArticle  19\nand\n21.\nIt was in\nKharak Singh v. State of U.P. &  Ors.\n(1)\nthat the question as to the, proper scope and meaning of the\nexpression     personal\t liberty'  came\t up   pointedly\t  for\nconsideration  for  the first time before this\tCourt.\t The\nmajority of the Judges took the view \"that personal liberty'\nis  used  in the article as a compendious  term\t to  include\nwithin\titself all the varieties of rights which go to\tmake\nup  the\t personal liberties' of man other than\tthose  dealt\nwith  in  the several clauses of\nArticle  19(1).\nIn  other\nwords, while\nArticle 19(1)\ndeals with particular species  or\nattributes of that freedom, 'personal liberty' in\nArticle 21\ntakes  in and comprises the residue\".  The Minority  judges,\nhowever, disagreed with this view taken by the majority\t and\nexplained their position in the following words : \"No  doubt\nthe expression 'personal liberty' is a comprehensive one and\nthe  right  to\tmove  freely is\t an  attribute\tof  personal\nliberty.   It  is said that the freedom to  move  freely  is\ncarved\t out  of  personal  liberty  and,   therefore,\t the\nexpression  'personal liberty' in\nArticle 21\nexcludes\tthat\nattribute.   In\t our view, this is not a  correct  approach.\nBoth  are  independent fundamental rights, though  there  is\noverlapping.   There is no question of one being carved\t out\nof  another.   The fundamental right of\t life  and  personal\nliberty\t has many attributes and some of them are  found  in\nArticle\t 19.\nIf a person's fundamental right under\nArticle\n21\nis infringed, the State can rely upon a law\t to  sustain\nthe action, but that cannot be a complete answer unless\t the\nsaid  law satisfies the test\nlaid down in\nArticle  19(2)\nso\nfar   as  the  attributes  covered  by\nArticle\t 19(1)\nare\nconcerned\".\nThere  can  be no doubt that in  view  of\t the\ndecision of this Court in R. C. Cooper v. Union of  India(2)\nthe  minority  view  must be regarded  as  correct  and\t the\nmajority view must be held to have been overruled.  We shall\nhave  occasion to analyse and discuss the decision in R.  C.\nCooper's case a little later when we deal with the arguments\nbased  on infraction of\nArticles 19(1) (a)\nand\n19  (1)\t(g)\n,\nbut it is sufficient to state for the present that according\nto  this  decision, which was a decision given by  the\tfull\nCourt, the fundamental rights conferred by Part III are\t not\ndistinct  and mutually exclusive rights.  Each\tfreedom\t has\ndifferent  dimensions  and  merely  because  the  limits  of\ninterference with one freedom are satisfied, the .law is not\nfreed  from the necessity to meet the challenge\t of  another\nguaranteed freedom.\nThe decision in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's (supra)\ncase  gave  rise  to  the theory  that\tthe  freedoms  under\nArticles  19\n,  21\n,  22\nand\n31\nare  exclusive-each  article\nenacting  a  code  relating to the  protection\tof  distinct\nrights,\t but this theory was over-turned in R.\tC.  Cooper's\ncase (supra) where Shah, J., speaking on behalf of the majo-\nrity pointed out that \"Part III of the Constitution weaves a\npattern of guarantees on the texture of basic human: rights.\nThe  guarantees\t delimit the protection of those  rights  in\ntheir  allotted\t fields : they do not attempt  to  enunciate\ndistinct  rights.\"  The conclusion was summarised  in  these\nterms : \"In our judgment, the assumption in A. K.\n(1)  [1964] 1 S.C.R. 332.\n(2)  [1973] 3 S.C.R. 530.\n670\nGopalan\n's  case\t that certain articles in  the\tConstitution\nexclusively deal with specific matters cannot be accepted as\ncorrect\".\nIt was hold in R. C. Cooper's case and  that  is\nclear from the judgment of Shah, J., because Shah, J., in so\nmany  terms  disapproved of the contrary  statement  of\t law\ncontained in the opinions of Kania, C. J., Patanjali Sastri,\nJ., Mahajan, J., Mukherjee, J., and S. R. Das, J., in\nA.  K.\nGopalan\n's  case\t that  even where a person  is\tdetained  in\naccordance with the procedure prescribed by law, as mandated\nby\nArticle  21\n,  the protection conferred  by\tthe  various\nclauses\t of\nArticle 19(1)\ndoes not cease to be available  to\nhim  and the law authorising such detention has\t to  satisfy\nthe test of the applicable freedom under\nArticle 19\n,  clause\n(1).  This would clearly show that\nArticles 19(1)\nand\n21\nare\nnot mutually exclusive, for, if they were, there would be no\nquestion  of  a law depriving a person of  personal  liberty\nwithin\tthe  meaning  of\nArticle  21\nhaving  to  meet\t the\nchallenge  of  a  fundamental  right  under\nArticle  19(1).\nIndeed,\t in that event, a law of preventive detention  which\ndeprives  a  person of 'personal liberty' in  the  narrowest\nsense,\tnamely,\t freedom  from\tdetention  and\tthus   falls\nindisputably  within\nArt. 21\nwould not require to be  tested\non the touchstone of clause (d) of\nArticle 19 (1)\nand yet it\nwas held by a Bench of seven Judges of this Court in\nShambhu\nNath Sarkar v. The State of West Bengal& Ors.\n(1) that\tsuch\na  law would have to satisfy the requirement inter  alia  of\nArticle\t 19  (1)\n,  clause (d) and in\nHaradhan  Saha  v.\t The\nState, of West Bengal & Ors.\n, (2) which was a decision given\nby  a  Bench  of  five judges,\tthis  Court  considered\t the\nchallenge   of\t clause\t (d)  of\nArticle   19(1)\nto\t the\nconstitutional\tvalidity  of  the\nMaintenance\tof  Internal\nSecurity  Act, 1971\nand held that that Act did\tnot  violate\nthe  constitutional guarantee embodied in that article.\t  It\nis  indeed difficult to see on what principle we can  refuse\nto  give  its  plain natural meaning  to  the  expression  '\npersonal  liberty'  as used in\nArticle 21\nand read it  in  a\nnarrow\t and  restricted  sense\t so  as\t to  exclude   those\nattributes of personal liberty which are specifically  dealt\nwith  in\nArticle 19.\nWe do not think that this would  be  a\ncorrect\t way  of interpreting the provisions  of  the  Cons-\ntitution conferring fundamental rights.\t The attempt of\t the\ncourt  should  be  to  expand the reach\t and  ambit  of\t the\nfundamental  rights rather than attenuate their meaning\t and\ncontent\t by  a process of judicial construction.\nThe\twave\nlength\tfor  comprehending  the\t scope\tand  ambit  of\t the\nfundamental  rights  has  been set by this Court  in  R.  C.\nCooper's case and our approach in the interpretation of\t the\nfundamental  rights  must  now be in tune  with\t this  wave,\nlength.\t  We  may point out even at the cost  of  repetition\nthat this Court has said in so; many terms in R. C. Cooper's\ncase  that each freedom has different dimensions  and  there\nmay be overlapping between different fundamental rights\t and\ntherefore  it  is  not a' valid argument  to  say  that\t the\nexpression  'personal  liberty'\t in\nArticle 21\nmust  be  so\ninterpreted as to avoid overlapping between that article and\nArticle 19(1).\nThe expression 'personal liberty' in\nArticle\n21\nis\tof the widest amplitude and it covers a\t variety  of\nrights\twhich go to constitute the personal liberty  of\t man\nand some of them have been raised to the status of  distinct\nfundamental  rights  and given additional  protection  under\nArticle 19.\nNow, it has been\n(1)  [1973] 1 SCR 856.\n(2)  [1975] 1 S.C.R. 778.\n671\nheld  by this Court in Satwant Singh's case  that  'personal\nliberty'  within the meaning of\nArticle 21\nincludes  within\nits ambit the right to go abroad and consequently no  person\ncan be deprived of this right except according to  procedure\nprescribed by law.  Prior to the enactment of the\nPassports\nAct, 1967\n, there was no law regulating the right of a person\nto  go abroad and that was the reason why the order  of\t the\nPassport   Officer  refusing  to  issue\t passport   to\t the\npetitioner  in\tSatwant\t Singh's case  was  struck  down  as\ninvalid.   It  win  be seen at once  from  the\tlanguage  of\nArticle 21\nthat the protection it secures is a limited\tone.\nIt  safeguards\tthe  right to go  abroad  against  executive\ninterference  which  is not supported by law; and  law\there\nmeans 'en-. acted law' or 'State Law'.\tVide A. K. Gopalan's\ncase.\tThus, no person can be deprived of his right to,  go\nabroad\tunless there is a law made by the State\t prescribing\nthe  procedure for so depriving him and the  deprivation  is\neffected strictly in accordance with such procedure.  It was\nfor this reason, in order to comply with the requirement  of\nArticle 21\n, that Parliament enacted the\nPassports Act,\t1967\nfor regulating the tight to go abroad.\tIt is clear from the\nprovisions of the\nPassports, Act, 1967\nthat is lays down the\ncircumstances  under  which  a passport\t may  be  issued  or\nrefused\t or  cancelled or impounded and\t also  prescribes  a\nprocedure for doing so, but the question is whether that  is\nsufficient compliance with\nArticle 21.\nIs the\tprescription\nof  some  sort\tof procedure enough or\tmust  the  procedure\ncomply\t with  any  particular\trequirements  ?\t  Obviously,\nprocedure cannot be arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable.\tThis\nindeed was conceded by the learned Attorney General who with\nhis  usual candour frankly stated that it was  not  possible\nfor  him to contend that any procedure howsoever  arbitrary,\noppressive  or unjust may be prescribed by the\tlaw.\nThere\nwas some discussion in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case in regard to the\nnature\tof  the procedure required to  be  prescribed  under\nArticle\t 21\nand at least three of the learned Judges out  of\nfive  expressed\t themselves strongly in favour of  the\tview\nthat  the  procedure cannot be any arbitrary,  fantastic  or\noppressive procedure.  Fazal Ali, J., who was in a minority,\nwent to the farthest limit in saying that the procedure must\ninclude the four essentials, set out in Prof.  Willi's\tbook\non  Constitutional  Law, namely, notice, opportunity  to  be\nheard, impartial tribunal and ordinary course of  procedure.\nPatanjali  Sastri, J. did not go as far as that but  he\t did\nsay  that \"certain basic principles emerged as the  constant\nfactors\t known to all those procedures and they\t formed\t the\ncore of the procedure established by law.\" Mahajan, J., also\nobserved that\nArticle 21\nrequires that \"there should be some\nform  of proceeding before a person can be condemned  either\nin respect of his life or his liberty\" and \"it negatives the\nidea  of  fantastic,  arbitrary\t and  oppressive  forms\t  of\nproceedings\".\nBut apart altogether from these\tobservations\nin\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case, which have great weight,  we\tfind\nthat even on principle the concept of reasonableness must be\nprojected  in  the procedure contemplated  by\nArticle\t21\n,,\nhaving regard to the impact of\nArticle 14\non\nArticle 21.\n672\nThe inter-relationship between\narticles 14\n, 19\nand\n21\nWe  may\t at this stage consider the  inter-relation  between\nArticle\t 21\non the one hand and\nArticles 14\nand\n19\non\t the\nother.\t We have already pointed out that the view taken  by\nthe majority in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case war,. that so long as a\nlaw  of preventive detention satisfies the  requirements  of\nArticle\t 22\n, it would be within the terms of\nArticle 21\nand\nit  would not be required to meet the challenge\t of  Article\n19.  This  view proceeded on the  assumption  that  \"certain\narticles in the constitution exclusively deal with  specific\nmatters\"  and where the requirements of an  article  dealing\nwith  the  particular matter in question are  satisfied\t and\nthere is no infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed\nby  that  article, no recourse can be had to  a\t fundamental\nright  conferred  by  another  article.\t  This\tdoctrine  of\nexclusivity was seriously questioned in R. C. Cooper's\tcase\nand it was over-ruled by a majority of the Full Court,\tonly\nRay,  J., as he then was, dissenting.  The  majority  judges\nheld that though a law of preventive detention may pass\t the\ntest  of\nArticle 22\n, it has yet to satisfy the\trequirements\nof  other fundamental rights such as\nArticle 19.\nThe  ratio\nof  the\t majority  judgment  in\t R.  C.\t Cooper's  case\t was\nexplained  in  clear and categorical terms  by\tShelat,\t J.,\nspeaking on behalf of seven judges of this Court in\nShambhu\nNath  Sarkar v. State of West Bengal\n(1).  The learned  Judge\nthere said :\n\"In\nGopalan\n's case (supra) the majority  court\nhad held that\nArticle 22\nwas a  self-contained\nCode   and  therefore  a\tlaw  of\t  preventive\ndetention did not have to satisfy the require-\nment  of\nArticles 19\n, 14\nand\n21.\nThe view  of\nFazal  Ali,  J., on the other hand,  was\tthat\npreventive  detention was a direct  breach  of\nthe right under\nArticle 19 (1) (d)\nand that  a\nlaw providing for preventive detention. had to\nbe  subject  to  such judicial  review  as  is\nobtained under clause (5) of that Article.\nIn\nR.  C. Cooper v. Union of India,\t(supra)\t the\naforesaid\t  premise,   of\t the   majority\t  in\nGopalan's\t case  (supra) was  disapproved\t and\ntherefore\t it  no\t longer\t holds\tthe   field.\nThough  Cooper's case (supra) dealt  with\t the\ninter-relationship  of\nArticle 19\nand\nArticle\n31\n,  the\tbasic  approach\t to  construing\t the\nfundamental rights guaranteed in the different\nprovisions of the Constitution adopted in this\ncase held the major premise of the majority in\nGopalan\n's case (supra) to be incorrect.\"\nSubsequently,  in\nHaradhan Saha v. State of West  Bengal  &\nOrs.\n(2)\t also, a Bench of five Judges of this  Court,  after\nreferring to the decisions in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case and R. C.\nCooper's  case,\t agreed\t that the\nMaintenance\tof  Internal\nSecurity Act, 1971\n, which is a law of preventive  detention,\nhas  to\t be  tested in regard  to  its\treasonableness\twith\nreference to\nArticle 19.\nThat decision accepted and applied\nthe  ratio in R. C. Cooper's case and Shambhu Nath  Sarkar's\ncase  and proceeded to consider the challenge of\nArticle  19\nto  the\t constitutional\t validity  of  the\nMaintenance\t  of\nInternal  Security Act, 1971\nand held that the Act  did\t not\nviolate\t any of the constitutional guarantees  enshrined  in\nArt.  19.\nThe same view was affirmed once again by a  Bench\nof four\n(1)  [1973] S.C.R.856.\n(1)  [1975] S.C.R.778.\n673\njudges\tof this Court in\nKhudiram Das v. The State  of\tWest\nBengal\t &  Ors.\n(1)  Interestingly,  even  prior  to   these\ndecisions, as pointed out by Dr. Rajive Dhawan, in his\tbook\n: \"The Supreme Court of India :\" at page 235, reference\t was\nmade,  by this court in\nMohd.  Sabir v. State of  Jammu\t and\nKashmir\n(2)  to\narticle 191(2)\nto justify preventive;  deten-\ntion.\tThe  law, must, therefore, now be taken to  be\twell\nsettled that\nArticle 21\ndoes not exclude\nArticle 19\nand that\neven if there is a law prescribing a procedure for depriving\na person of 'personal liberty' and there is consequently  no\ninfringement  of the fundamental right conferred by\nArticle\n21\n,  such  law, in so far as it abridges or takes  away\t any\nfundamental  right under\nArticle 19\nwould have to  meet\t the\nchallenge  of that article.\nThis proposition can no  longer\nbe  disputed  after the decisions in R.\t C.  Cooper's  case,\nShambhu\t Nath Sarkar\n's case and\nHaradhan Saha\n's case.\tNow,\nif  a  law  depriving a person\tof  'personal  liberty'\t and\nprescribing a procedure for that purpose within the  meaning\nof\nArticle 21\nhas to stand the test of one or more  of\t the\nfundamental  rights conferred under\nArticle 19\nwhich may  be\napplicable  in a given situation, ex hypothesi it must\talso\nbe  liable to be tested with reference to\nArticle 14.\nThis\nwas in fact not disputed by the learned Attorney General and\nindeed\the  could  not\tdo  so in  view\t of  the  clear\t and\ncategorical  statement\tmade  by Mukharjea,  J.,  in\nA.  K.\nGopalan\n's case that\nArticle 21 \"\npresupposes that the law  is\na  valid  and  binding\tlaw  under  the\t provisions  of\t the\nConstitution   having  regard  to  the\tcompetence  of\t the\nlegislature  and  the  subject it relates to  and  does\t not\ninfringe   any\t of  the  fundamental\trights\t which\t the\nConstitution  provides\tfor\", including\nArticle  14.\nThis\nCourt  also  applied\nArticle  14\nin  two  of\tits  earlier\ndecisions,  namely,\nThe State of West Bengal v.  Anwar\t Ali\nSarkar\n(\n3)   and\t  Kathi\t Raning\t Rawat\tv.  The\t  State\t  of\nSaurashtra\n(4)  where there was a special law  providing\t for\ntrial  of certain offences by a speedier process which\ttook\naway  some of the safeguards available to an  accused  under\nthe ordinary procedure in the\nCriminal Procedure Code\n.\nThe\nspecial\t law  in each of these two cases  undoubtedly  pres-\ncribed\ta procedure for trial of the specified offences\t and\nthis  procedure could not be condemned as inherently  unfair\nor unjust and there was thus compliance with the requirement\nof\nArticle 21\n, but even so, the validity of the special\t law\nwas  tested before the Supreme, Court on the  touchstone  of\nArticle\t 14\nand in one case, namely, Kathi  Raning  Rawat's\ncase,  the  validity was upheld and in\tthe  other,  namely,\nAnwar Ali Sarkar\n's case, it was struck down.  It was held in\nboth  these  cases  that the procedure\testablished  by\t the\nspecial\t law must not be violative of the  equality  clause.\nThat procedure must answer the requirement of\nArticle 14.\nThe  nature and requirement of the procedure  under  article\n21.\nNow,  the  question  immediately arises as to  what  is\t the\nrequirement of\nArticle 14 :\nwhat is the content and reach of\nthe great equalising principle enunciated in this article  ?\nThere  can  be no doubt that it is a founding faith  of\t the\nConstitution.  It is indeed the pillar on which\n(1)  [1975] 2 S.C.R.832.\n(2)  A.I. R.1971S.C.1713.\n(3)  [1952] S.C.R. 284.\n(4)  [1952] S.C.R. 435.\n674\nrests  securely the foundation of our  democratic  republic.\nAnd,  therefore,  it  must not be  subjected  to  a  narrow,\npedantic  or lexicographic approach._ No attempt  should  be\nmade to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for, to\ndo so would be to violate its activist magnitude.   Equality\nis a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it\ncannot\tbe  imprisoned Within  traditional  and\t doctrinaire\nlimits.\t We must reiterate here what was pointed out by\t the\nmajority  in\nE. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu &  Another\n(1)  namely,  that  \"from  a  positivistic  point  of  view,\nequality  is antithetic to arbitrariness.  In fact  equality\nand arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule\nof  law\t in  a republic, while the other, to  the  whim\t and\ncaprice of an absolute monarch.\t Where an act is  arbitrary,\nit  is implicit in it that it is unequal both  according  to\npolitical  logic  and constitutional law  and  is  therefore\nviolative  of\nArticle 14\".\nArticle 14\nstrikes,  at  arbi-\ntrariness in State action and ensures fairness and  equality\nof  treatment.\t The  principle\t of  reasonableness,   which\nlegally as well as philosophically, is an essential  element\nof equality or non-arbitrariness pervades\nArticle 14\nlike  a\nbrooding  omnipresence\tand the\t procedure  contemplated  by\nArticle\t 21\nmust answer the best of reasonableness in  order\nto be in conformity with\nArticle 14.\nIt must be \"'right and\njust  and fair\" and not arbitrary, fanciful  or\t oppressive;\notherwise,  it\twould  be  no  procedure  at  all  and\t the\nrequirement of\nArticle 21\nwould not be satisfied.\nHow  far  natural  justice  is\tair  essential\telement\t  of\nprocedure established by law.\nThe  question  immediately  arises  :  does  the   procedure\nprescribed  by\tthe\nPassports Act, 1967\nfor  impounding  a\npassport  meet the, test of this requirement ? Is it  'right\nor  fair or just' ? The argument of the petitioner was\tthat\nit is not, because it provides for impounding of a  passport\nwithout\t affording reasonable opportunity to the  holder  of\nthe  passport  to  be  heard in\t defence.   To\timpound\t the\npassport  of  a person, said the petitioner,  is  a  serious\nmatter,\t  since\t  it  prevents\thim  from   exercising\t his\nconstitutional\tright  to  go  abroad  and  such  a  drastic\nconsequence cannot in fairness be visited without  observing\nthe  principle of audi alteram partem.\tAny procedure  which\npermits impairment of the constitutional right to go  abroad\nwithout\t giving reasonable opportunity to show cause  cannot\nbut be condemned as unfair and unjust and hence, there is in\nthe  present case clear infringement of the  requirement  of\nArticle\t 21.\nNow,  it is true that  there  is\t no  express\nprovision in the\nPassports Act, 1967\nwhich requires that the\naudi   alteram\tpartem\trule  should  be   followed   before\nimpounding  a  passport, but that is not conclusive  of\t the\nquestion.  If the statute makes itself clear on this  point,\nthen no more question arises.  But even when the statute is\nsilent, the law may in a given case make an implication\t and\napply  the  principle  stated by Byles,\t J.,  in  Cooper  v.\nWandsworth   Board   of\t Works(2).   \"A\t  long\t course\t  of\ndecision---,  beginning with Dr. Bentley's case\t and  ending\nwith some very recent cases, establish that, although  there\nare  no\t positive words in the statute\trequiring  that\t the\nparty shall be heard, yet-the justice of the common law will\nsupply the omission of\n(1)  [1974]2S.C.R.348.\n(2)  [1863]14C.B.N.S.180.\n675\nthe  legislature\".   The principle of audi  alteram  partem,\nwhich mandates that no one shall be condemned unheard,\tpart\nof  the\t rules of natural justice.  In fact, there  are\t two\nmain  principles in which the rules of natural\tjustice\t are\nmanifested, namely, Nemo Judex in Sua Causa and audi alteram\npartem.\t  We are not concerned here with the  former,  since\nthere  is no case of bias urged here.  The question is\tonly\nin  regard to the right of hearing which involves  the\taudi\nalteram\t partem rule.  Can it be imported in  the  procedure\nfor impounding a passport ?\nWe  may commence the discussion of this question with a\t few\ngeneral observations to emphasise the increasing  importance\nof  natural  justice  in the field  of\tadministrative\tlaw.\nNatural justice is a great humanising principle intended  to\ninvest law with' fairness and to secure justice and over the\nyears  it has grown into a widely pervasive  rule  affecting\nlarge areas of administrative action.  Lord Morris of Borth-\ny-Gest\tspoke of this rule in eloquent terms in his  address\nbefore the Bentham Club :\n\"We can, I think, take pride in what has\tbeen\ndone in recent periods and particularly in the\nfield of administrative law by invoking and by\napplying\tthese  principles which\t we  broadly\nclassify\tunder  the  designation\t of  natural\njustice.\t Many testing problems as  to  their\napplication  yet remain to be solved.   But  I\naffirm that the area of administrative\naction is but one area in which the principles\nare  to  be  deployed.  Nor  are\tthey  to  be\ninvoked  only  when  procedural  failures\t are\nshown.   Does  natural justice qualify  to  be\ndescribed\t as  a\t\"majestic\"  conception\t?  I\nbelieve it does.\tIs it just a rhetorical\t but\nvague  phrase  which  can\t be  employed,\twhen\nneeded,  to  give\t a gloss of  assurance\t?  I\nbelieve that it is very much more.\nIf it\t can\nbe summarised as being fair play in action-who\ncould wish that it would ever be out of action\n?\t It denotes that the law is not only  to  be\nguided  by  reason and by logic but  that\t its\npurpose %,,ill  not be fulfilled;\t it  lacks\nmore exalted inspiration.\" (Current Legal Pro-\nblems, 1973, Vol. 26, p. 16)\nAnd  then  again,  in his speech in the House  of  Lords  in\nWiseman\t v. Borneman\n(1), the learned Law Lord said in  words\nof inspired felicity:\n\"that the conception of natural justice should\nat  all  stages  guide  those  who   discharge\njudicial functions is not merely an acceptable\nbut is an essential part of the philosophy  of\nthe  law.\t  We  often speak of  the  rules  of\nnatural  justice.\t But there is nothing  rigid\nor   mechanical\tabout\tthem.\t What\tthey\ncomprehend has been analysed and described  in\nmany authorities.\t But any analysis must bring\ninto  relief  rather their  spirit  and  their\ninspiration  than any precision of  definition\nor  precision  as to application.\t We  do\t not\nsearch  for prescriptions which will lay\tdown\nexactly\twhat  must,  in\t various   divergent\nsituations,  be  done.   The  principles\t and\nprocedures are\n(1)   [1971]A.C.297.\n676\nto   be  applied\twhich,\tin  any\t  particular\nsituation\t or set of circumstances, are  right\nand  just and fair.  Natural justice,  it\t has\nbeen said, is only \"fair play in action.\"\t Nor\ndo  we  wait for directions  from\t Parliament.\nThe common law has abundant riches : there  we\nmay  find what Byles, J., called \"the  justice\nof the common law\".\nThus,\tthe  soul  of natural justice is  fair\tplay  in\naction'\t and  that  is\twhy  it\t has  received\tthe   widest\nrecognition throughout the democratic world.  In the  United\nStates,\t the right to an administrative hearing is  regarded\nas  essential requirement of fundamental fairness.   And  in\nEngland\t too  it has been held that 'fair  play\t in  action'\ndemands\t that  before any prejudicial or adverse  action  is\ntaken  against a person, he must be given an opportunity  to\nbe  heard.   The rule was stated by Lord  Henning,  M.R.  in\nthese  terms  in  Schmidt v. Secretary\tof  State  for\tHome\nAffairs(1)  :-where a public officer has power to deprive  a\nperson of his liberty or his property, the general principle\nis  that it has not to be done without his being  given\t an\nopportunity of being heard and of making representations  on\nhis  own  behalf\".   The same rule also\t prevails  in  other\nCommonwealth  countries\t like  Canada,\tAustralia  and\t New\nZealand.   It has even gained access to the United  Nations.\nVide  American Journal of International Law, Vol.  67,\tpage\n479.\tMagarry,  J.,  describes  natural  justice   \"as   a\ndistillate  of\tdue  process  of  law\".\t Vide  Fontaine\t  v.\nChesterton(2).\t It  is the quintessence of the\t process  of\njustice inspired and guided by fair play in action'.  If  we\nlook  at the speeches of the various law Lords in  Wiseman's\ncase,  it  will\t be seen that each one\tof  them  asked\t the\nquestion  \"whether  in the particular circumstances  of\t the\ncase,  the Tribunal acted unfairly so that it could be\tsaid\nthat  their  procedure\tdid  not  match\t with  what  justice\ndemanded\",  ,or, was the procedure adopted by  the  Tribunal\n'in  all  the circumstances unfair'?  The  test\t adopted  by\nevery law Lord was whether the procedure followed was  \"fair\nin all the circumstances\" and 'fair play in action' required\nthat an opportunity should be given to the tax payer \"to see\nand  reply  to the counter-statement of\t the  Commissioners\"\nbefore reaching the conclusion that \"there is a prima  facie\ncase against him.\" The inquiry must, therefore, always be  :\ndoes  fairness\tin action demand that an opportunity  to  be\nheard should be given to the person affected ?\nNow, if this be the test of applicability of the doctrine of\nnatural\t justice,  there  can be no  distinction  between  a\nquasi-judicial\tfunction and an administrative function\t for\nthis  purpose.\t The aim of both administrative\t inquiry  as\nwell  as  quasi-judicial  inquiry is to\t arrive\t at  a\tjust\ndecision  and if a rule of natural justice Is calculated  to\nsecure\tjustice,  or  to  put  it  negatively,\tto   prevent\nmiscarriage of justice, it is difficult to see why it should\nbe   applicable\t to  quasi-judicial  inquiry  and   not\t  to\nadministrative\tinquiry.  It must logically apply  to  both.\nOn  what principle can distinction be made between  one\t and\nthe  other ?  Can it be said that the requirement  of  'fair\nplay in action' is any the\n(1)  [1969] 2 Chancery Division 149.\n(2)  (1968) 112 Solicitor General 690.\n677\nless in an administrative inquiry than in a  quasi--judicial\none?   Sometimes  an unjust decision  in  an  administrative\ninquiry\t may  have  far more  serious  consequences  than  a\ndecision in a quasi-judicial inquiry and hence the rules  of\nnatural\t justice  must apply equally  in  an  administrative\ninquiry\t  which\t entails-civil\tconsequences.\tThere\twas,\nhowever,  a time in the early stages of the  development  of\nthe doctrine of natural justice when the view prevailed that\nthe  rules  of natural justice have application\t only  to  a\nquasi-judicial\t proceeding   as   distinguished   from\t  an\nadministrative proceeding and the distinguishing feature  of\na quasi-judicial proceeding is that the authority  concerned\nis required by the, law under which it is functioning to act\njudicially.  This requirement of a duty to act judicially in\norder to invest the function with a quasi,judicial character\nwas spelt out from the following observation of Atkin,\tL.J.\nin  Rex v. Electricity Commissioners(1), \"wherever any\tbody\nof  persons  having legal authority to\tdetermine  questions\naffecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act\njudicially, act in excess of their legal authority, they are\nsubject\t to the controlling jurisdiction of the\t King  Bench\nDivision.  . . .\". Lord Hewart, C.J., in Rex V.\t Legislative\nCommittee   of\tthe  Church  Assembly,\t(  2  )\t read\tthis\nobservation  to mean that the duty to act judicially  should\nbe  an additional requirement existing independently of\t the\n\"authority  to determine questions affecting the  rights  of\nsubjects\"-something super added to it.\tThis gloss placed by\nLord  Hewart,  C.J.,  on the dictum  of\t Lord  Atkin,  L.J.,\nbedevilled  the law for a considerable time  and  stultified\nthe  growth of the doctrine of natural justice.\t  The  Court\nwas constrained in every case that came before it, to make a\nsearch for the duty to act judicially sometimes from tenuous\nmaterial  and sometimes in the services of the\tstatute\t and\nthis  led to oversubtlety and over-refinement  resulting  in\nconfusion and uncertainty in the law.  But this was  plainly\ncontrary to the earlier authorities and in the\tepoch-making\ndecision of the House of Lords in Ridge v. Baldwin(3), which\nmarks  a turning point in the history of the development  of\nthe  doctrine of natural justice, Lord Reid pointed out\t how\nthe   gloss   of  Lord\tHewart,\t C.J.,\twas   based   on   a\nmisunderstanding of the; observations of Atkin, L.J., and it\nwent counter to the law laid down in the earlier  decisions,\nof  the Court.\tLord Reid observed : \"If Lord  Hewart  meant\nthat it is never enough that a body has a duty to  determine\nwhat  the rights of an individual should be, but that  there\nmust always be something more to impose on it a duty to\t act\njudicially, then that appears to me impossible to  reconcile\nwith  the earlier authorities\".\t The learned law  Lord\theld\nthat  the  duty to act judicially may arise  from  the\tvery\nnature of the function intended to be performed' and it need\nnot be shown to be superadded.\tThis decision, broadened the\narea  of application of the rules of natural justice and  to\nborrow\tthe words of Prof.  Clar in his article on  'Natural\nJustice, Substance and Shadow' in Public Law Journal,  1975,\nrestored   light  to  an  area\t\"benighted  by\tthe   narrow\nconceptualism of the previous decade\".\nThis development  in\nthe  law had its parallel in India in the\nAssociated  Cement\nCompanies Ltd. v. P. N. Sharma & Anr\n(4) where\n(1)  [1924] 1 K.B.171.\n(2)  [1928] 1 K.B.411.\n(3)  [1964] A. C. 40.\n(4)  [1965] 2 S.C.R. 366.\n5-119 SCT/78\n678\nthis Court approvingly referred to the decision in Ridge  v.\nBaldwin\t (supra)  and,\tlater  in\nState\t of  Orissa  v.\t Dr.\nBinapani\n(1) observed that : \"If there is power to decide and\ndetermine  to  the  prejudice  of  a  person,  duty  to\t act\njudicially is implicit in the exercise of such power\".\nThis\nCourt  also, pointed out in\nA.K. Kraipak & Ors. v. Union  of\nIndia & Ors.\n(2) another historic decision in this branch of\nthe law, that in recent years the concept of  quasi-judicial\npower  has  been undergoing radical change  and\t said:\t\"The\ndividing  line between an administrative power and a  quasi-\njudicial power is quite thin and is being gradually  oblite-\nrated, for determining whether a power is an administrative,\npower  or  a  quasi-judicial power one has to  look  to\t the\nnature of the power conferred, the person or persons on whom\nit  is conferred, the framework of the law  conferring\tthat\npower,\tthe consequences ensuing from the exercise  of\tthat\npower  and the manner in which that power is expected to  be\nexercised\".  The net effect of these and other decisions was\nthat the duty to act judicially need not be super-added, but\nit may be spelt out from the nature of the power  conferred,\nthe manner of exercising it and its impact on the rights  of\nthe  person  effected and where it is found  to\t exist,\t the\nrules of, natural justice would be attracted.\nThis  was  the advance made by the law as a  result  of\t the\ndecision  in  Ridge v. Baldwin (supra) in  England  and\t the\ndecision  in\nAssociated Cement Companies\n's case (supra)\t and\nother  cases following upon it, in India.  But that was\t not\nto be the end of the development of the law on this subject.\nThe    proliferation   of   administrative   law    provoked\nconsiderable fresh thinking on the subject and soon it\tcame\nto be recognised that 'fair play in action' required that in\nadministrative\tproceeding  also, the  doctrine\t of  natural\njustice\t must  be held to be applicable.   We  have  already\ndiscussed this aspect of the question on principal and shown\nwhy no distinction can be made between an administrative and\na   quasi-judicial   proceeding\t  for\tthe;   purpose\t  of\napplicability  of  the doctrine of  natural  justice.\tThis\nposition  was  judicially recognised and  accepted  and\t the\ndichotomy   between   administrative   and    quasi-judicial\nproceedings  vis-a-vis\tdoctrine  of  natural  justice\t was\nfinally\t discarded  as unsound by the decisions in In  re  :\nH.K. (All Infant) (3) and Schmidt v. Secretary of State\t for\nHome  Affairs  (supra) in England and, so far  as  India  is\nconcerned, by the memorable decision rendered by this  Court\nin\nA.K. Kraipak\n's case (supra).\nLord Parker, C.J.\npointed\t out in the course of his judgment in In Re  :\nH.K.\n(An  Infant\n) (supra) :\n\"But  at the same time,, I myself\t think\tthat\neven  if\tan Immigration officer is not  in  a\njudicial or\t   quasi-judicial  capacity,\nhe  must\tat any rate give  the  immigrant  an\nopportunity  of satisfying him of the  matters\nin  the sub-section, and for that purpose\t let\nthe   immigrant\tknow  what   his   immediate\nimpression  is  so  that\tthe  immigrant\t can\ndisabuse him.

B. 617.\n679\nis  not, as I see it, a question of acting  or\nbeing required to act judicially, but of being\nrequired\tto act fairly.\tGood  administration\nand an honest or bonafide decision must, as it\nseems    to   me,.   required    not    merely\nimpartiality,  nor merely bringing one's\tmind\nto bear on the problem, but acting fairly; and\nto  the limited extent that the  circumstances\nof  any particular case allow, and within\t the\nlegislative   framework\tunder\twhich\t the\nadministrator is working, only to that limited\nextent  do  the  so-called  rules\t of  natural\njustice apply, which in a case such as this is\nmerely  a\t duty to act fairly.   I  appreciate\nthat in saying that it may be said that one is\ngoing further than is permitted on the decided\ncases  because  heretofore  at  any  rate\t the\ndecisions of the courts do seem to have  drawn\na\t strict line in these matters  according  to\nwhether  there  is or' is not a  duty  to\t act\njudicially or quasi-judicially.\"\nThis Court, speaking through Hegde, J., in ,I.\tK. Kraipak's\ncase  quoted  with  approval  the  above  passage  from\t the\njudgment of Lord Parker, C.J., and proceeded to add :\n\"The aim of the rules of natural justice is to\nsecure  justice  or to put  it  negatively  to\nprevent  miscarriage of justice.\tThese  rules\ncan  operate only in areas not covered by\t any\nlaw validly made.\t In other words they do\t not\nsupplant\tthe law of the land  but  supplement\nit-Till  very recently it was the\t opinion  of\nthe courts that unless the authority concerned\nwas  required  by\t the  law  under  which\t  it\nfunctioned to act judicially there was no room\nfor  the, application of the rules of  natural\njustice.\t The validity of that limitation  is\nnow  questioned.\tIf the purpose of the  rules\nof  natural justice is to prevent\t miscarriage\nof  justice One fails to see why\tthose  rules\nshould be made inapplicable, to administrative\nenquiries.  Often times it is not easy to draw\nthe   line  that\t demarcates   administrative\nenquiries\t  from\t quasi-judicial\t  enquiries.\nEnquiries which were considered administrative\nat  one  time  are  now  being  considered  as\nquasi-.judicial  in character.  Arriving at  a\njust  decision  is  the  aim  of\tboth  quasi-\njudicial\tenquiries as well as  administrative\nenquiries.    An\t unjust\t  decision   in\t  an\nadministrative  enquiry  may  have  more\t far\nreaching\teffect than a decision in  a  quasi-\njudicial\tenquiry.  As observed by this  Court\nin\nSuresh Koshy George v. The University\t of\nKerala  and Ors.\n(1969)1 S.C.R. 317 the  rules\nof  natural  justice are not  embodied  rules.\nWhat particular rule of natural justice should\napply  to a given case must depend to a  great\nextent on the facts and circumstances of\tthat\ncase the framework of the law under which\t the\nenquiry  is held and the constitution  of\t the\nTribunal or body of persons appointed for that\npurpose.\tWhenever a complaint is made  before\na\t court\tthat  some  principles\tof   natural\njustice had been contravened the court has  to\ndecide whether the observance of that rule was\nnecessary for a just decision on the facts  of\nthe case.\"\n680\nThis view was reiterated and re-affirmed in  a\nsubsequent  decision of this Court  in\nD.F.O.\nSouth  Khari v. Ram Sanehi Singh\n(1).  The\t law\nmust,  therefore,\t now  be taken\tto  be\twell\nsettled\tthat  even  in\t an   administrative\nproceeding, which involves civil consequences,\nthe  doctrine of natural justice must be\theld\nto be applicable.\nNow, here, the power conferred on the Passport\nAuthority\t is  to impound a passport  and\t the\nconsequence of impounding a passport would  be\nto  impair  the constitutional  right  of\t the\nholder of the passport to go abroad during the\ntime   that   the\t  passport   is\t  impounded.\nMoreover,\t a passport can be impounded by\t the\nPassport\tAuthority only on certain  specified\ngrounds set out in sub-section (3) of\nsection\n10\nand the Passport Authority would  have  to\napply its mind to the facts and  circumstances\nof a given case and decide whether any of\t the\nspecified\t grounds exists which would  justify\nimpounding  of  the  passport.   The  Passport\nAuthority is also required by sub-section\t (5)\nof\nsection  10\nto record in writing  a  brief\nstatement\t of the reasons for making an  order\nimpounding  a  passport and, save\t in  certain\nexceptional situations, the Passport Authority\nis obliged to furnish a copy of the  statement\nof  reasons  to the bolder  of  the  passport.\nWhere  the  Passport Authority which  has\t im-\npounded  a passport is other than the  Central\nGovernment,  a  right of\tappeal\tagainst\t the\norder impounding the passport is given by\nsection 11\n, and in\nthe  appeal,  the  validity  of the  reasons  given  by\t the\nPassport  Authority  for  impounding  the  passport  can  be\ncanvassed before the Appellate Authority.  It is clear on  a\nconsideration of these circumstances that the test\nlaid down\nin\nthe decisions of this Court for distinguishing between  a\nquasi-judicial\t power\tand  an\t administrative\t  power\t  is\nsatisfied and the power conferred on the Passport  Authority\nto impound a passport is quasi-judicial power.\nThe rules of\nnatural\t justice would, in the circumstances, be  applicable\nin  the exercise of the power of impounding a passport\teven\non  the\t orthodox  view\t which prevailed  prior to\nA.\tK.\nKraipak\n's case.\nThe same result must follow in view of\t the\ndecision  in\nA.  K. Kraipak\n's case, even if  the  power  to\nimpound\t a  passport  were  regarded  as  administrative  in\ncharacter,   because  it  seriously  interferes\t  with\t the\nconstitutional\tright  of the holder of the passport  to  go\nabroad and entails adverse civil consequences.\nNow,  as already pointed out, the doctrine  of\nnatural  justice consists principally  of\t two\nrules,  namely, nemo debt esse  judex  propria\ncause  :\tno one shall be a judge in  his\t own\ncause,  and audi alteram partem : no  decision\nshall   be  given\t against  a  party   without\naffording\t him a reasonable hearing.   We\t are\nconcerned here with the second rule and  hence\nwe   shall   confine  ourselves  only   to   a\ndiscussion of that rule.\tThe learned Attorney\nGeneral,\tappearing on behalf of the Union  of\nIndia,  fairly conceded that the audi  alteram\npartem rule is a highly effective tool devised\nby the courts to enable a statutory  authority\nto  arrive  at  a\t just  decision\t and  it  is\ncalculated to act as a healthy check on  abuse\nor misuse of power and hence its reach  should\nnot be narrowed and its applicability  circum-\nscribed.\t  He  rightly  did  not\t plead\t for\nreconsideration of the historic advances\tmade\nin  the  law as a result of the  decisions  of\nthis Court and did\n(1)   [1973] 3S.C.C.864.\n681\nnot suggest that the Court should re-trace its\nsteps.   That  would indeed have been  a\tmost\nstartling argument coming from the  Government\nof  India and for the Court to accede to\tsuch\nan  argument would have been so act  of  utter\nretrogression.\tBut  fortunately   no\tsuch\nargument was advanced by the learned  Attorney\nGeneral.\t What  he urged was a  very  limited\ncontention,  namely that having regard to\t the\nnature   of   the\t action\t involved   in\t the\nimpounding  of  a passport, the  audi  alteram\npartem  rule  must be held  to,  be  excluded,\nbecause if notice were to be given to the hol-\nder of the passport and reasonable opportunity\nafforded to him to show cause why his passport\nshould not be impounded, he might immediately,\non the strength of the passport, make good his\nexit  from  the  country\tand  the  object  of\nimpounding  the passport would be\t frustrated.\nThe  argument  was that if  the  audi  alteram\npartem rule were applied, its effect would  be\nto  stultify  the\t power\tof  impounding\t the\npassport and it would defeat and paralyse\t the\nadministration  of the law and hence the\taudi\nalteram  partem  rule cannot  in\tfairness  be\napplied while exercising the power to  impound\na\t passport.  This, argument was sought to  be\nsupported by reference to the statement of the\nlaw  in  A.S.  de Smith,\tJudicial  Review  of\nAdministrative  Action,  2nd  ed.,  where\t the\nlearned  author  says  at page  174  that\t \"in\nadministrative,  law  a prima facie  right  to\nprior  notice and opportunity to be heard\t may\nbe held to be excluded by implication-where an\nobligation  to give notice and opportunity  to\nbe  heard would obstruct the taking of  prompt\naction,  especially action of a preventive  or\nremedial nature\".\t Now, it is true that  since\nthe  right to prior notice and opportunity  of\nhearing  arises only by implication  from\t the\nduty  to\tact fairly, or to use the  words  of\nLord  Morris of Borth-y-Gest, from 'fair play in action,  it\nmay  equally be excluded where, having regard to the  nature\nof  the action to be taken, its object and purpose  and\t the\nscheme\tof  the relevant statutory  provision,\tfairness  in\naction does not demand its implication and even warrants its\nexclusion.  There are certain well recognised exceptions  to\nthe  audi  alteram  partem  rule  established  by   judicial\ndecisions  and\tthey  are summarised by\t S.A.  de  Smith  in\nJudicial  Review of Administrative Action, 2nd ed., at\tpage\n168  to\t 179.\tIf  we analyse\tthese  exceptions  a  little\nclosely,  _it will be apparent that they do not in  any\t way\nmilitate  against the principle which requires fair play  in\nadministrative\taction.\t  The word 'exception' is  really  a\nmisnomer  because  in  these exclusionary  cases   the\taudi\nalteram\t partem rule is held inapplicable not by way  of  an\nexception  to  \"fair play in action\",  but  because  nothing\nunfair\tcan be inferred by not affording an  opportunity  to\npresent\t or  meet a case.  The audi alteram partem  rule  is\nintended  to  inject justice into the law and it  cannot  be\napplied\t to defeat the ends of justice, or to make  the\t law\n'lifeless,  absurd, stultifying, self-defeating\t or  plainly\ncontrary  to the common sense of the situation'.  Since\t the\nlife of the law is not logic but experience and every  legal\nproposition must, in the ultimate analysis, be tested on the\ntouchstone  of\tpragmatic realism, the audi  alteram  partem\nrule  would,  by  the experiential  test,  be  excluded,  if\nimporting the right to be heard has the effect of paralysing\nthe  administrative process or the need for  promptitude  or\nthe  urgency of the situation so demands.  But at  the\tsame\ntime  it  must be remembered that this is a  rule  of  vital\nimportance  in the field of administrative law and  it\tmust\nnot  be\t jettisoned save in very  exceptional  circumstances\nwhere compulsive necessity so demands.\n682\nIt is a wholesome rule designed to- secure the\nrule  of law and the court should not  be\t too\nready  to eschew it in its application  to  a\ngiven case.  True rue it is that in  questions\nof  this kind a fanatical or  doctrinaire\t ap-\nproach  should be avoided, but that  does\t not\nmean  that  merely  because  the\t traditional\nmethodology  of a formalised hearing may\thave\nthe effect of stultifying the exercise of\t the\nstatutory\t power,\t the  audi  alteram   partem\nshould  be  wholly excluded.  The\t court\tmust\nmake  every  effort to salvage  this  cardinal\nrule  to the maximum extent permissible  in  a\ngiven  case.   It must not be  forgotten\tthat\n\"natural justice is pragmatically flexible and\nis   amenable   to   capsulation\t under\t the\ncompulsive  pressure of  circumstances\".\t The\naudi  alteram  partem rule is not\t cast  in  a\nrigid  mould and judicial decisions  establish\nthat it may suffer situational  modifications.\nThe core of it must, however, remain,  namely,\nthat   the   per%on  affected  must   have   a\nreasonable opportunity of being heard and\t the\nhearing  must be a genuine hearing and not  an\nempty public relations exercise.  That is why Tucker,  L.J.,\nemphasised  in Russel v. Duke of Norfolk(1)  that  \"whatever\nstandard  of  natural justice is adopted, one  essential  is\nthat  the person concerned should have a  reasonable  oppor-\ntunity\tof  presenting his case\".  What opportunity  may  be\nregarded  as  reasonable  would necessarily  depend  on\t the\npractical  necessities\tof  the\t situation.   It  may  be  a\nsophisticated  fullfledged  hearing or it may be  a  hearing\nwhich is very brief and minimal : it may be a hearing  prior\nto the decision or it may even be a post-decisional remedial\nhearing.   The\taudi  alteram partem  rule  is\tsufficiently\nflexible to permit modifications and variations to suit\t the\nexigencies of myriad kinds of situations which max,  arise.\nThis  circumstantial flexibility of the audi alteram  partem\nrule  was  empbasised by Lord Reid in  Wiseman\tv.  Sorneman\n(supra)\t when  he said that he would be \"sorry to  see\tthis\nfundamental  general principle degenerate into a  series  of\nhard and fast rules\" and Lord Hailsham, L.C., also  observed\nin  Pearl-Berg\tV. Party(2) that the courts \"have  taken  in\nincreasingly  sophisticated  view  of what  is\trequired  in\nindividual  cases\".   It would not, therefore, be  right  to\nconclude  that\tthe  audi alteram partem  rule\tis  excluded\nmerely\tbecause\t the power to impound a\t passport  might  be\nfrustrated, if prior notice and hearing were to be given  to\nthe  person  concerned before impounding his  passport.\t the\nPassport  Authority  may  proceed to  impound  the  passport\nwithout giving any prior opportunity to the person concerned\nto  be\theard,\tbut  as soon as\t the  order  impounding\t the\npassport  is made, and opportunity of hearing,\tremedial  in\naim, should be given to him so that he may present his\tcase\nand controvert that of the Passport Authority and point\t out\nwhy  his  passport  should not be impounded  and  the  order\nimpounding  it recalled.  This should not only\tbe  possible\nbut   also  quite  appropriate,\t because  the  reasons\t for\nimpounding  the passport are required to be supplied by\t the\nPassport  Authority  after the making of the order  and\t the\nperson affected would, therefore, be in a position to make a\nrepresentation setting forth his case and plead for  setting\naside\tthe   action  impounding  his  passport.    A\tfair\nopportunity  of being heard following immediately  upon\t the\norder  impounding the passport would satisfy the mandate  of\nnatural\t justice  and a provision requiring giving  of\tsuch\nopportunity  to the person concerned can and should be\tread\nby\n(1)   [1949] 1 All Eng.  Reports 109.\n(2)   [1971] 1 Weekly Law Reports,728.\n683\nimplication  in the\nPassports Act,  1967\n.\t  If\nsuch a provision were held to be\tincorporated\nin  the\nPassports,  Act,\t 1967\nby  necessary\nimplication,  as\twe  hold  it  must  be,\t the\nprocedure prescribed by the Act for impounding\na\t passport would be fight, fair and just\t and\nit   would  not  suffer  from  the   vice\t  of\narbitrariness  or unreasonableness.  We  must,\ntherefore,    hold    that    the\t   procedure\n'established'  by the\nPassports Act, 1967\nfor\nimpounding  a passport is in  conformity\twith\nthe  requirement\tof\nArticle 21\nand  does\t not\nfall foul of that article.\nBut  the\tquestion  then\timmediately   arises\nwhether  the Central Government  has  complied\nwith this procedure in impounding the passport\nof  the  Petitioner.  Now, it is\tobvious\t and\nindeed this could not be controverted that the\nCentral  Government not only did not  give  an\nopporgive\t an  opportunity of hearing  to\t the\npetitioner after making the impugned order im-\npounding\ther  passport but even\tdeclined  to\nfurnish  to  the petitioner  the\treasons\t for\nimpounding  her passport despite request\tmade\nby her.  We have already pointed out that\t the\nCentral  Government was wholly unjustified  in\nwithholding  the\treasons for  impounding\t the\npassport from the petitioner and this was\t not\nonly in breach of the statutory provision, but\nit  also amounted to denial of opportunity  of\nhearing\tto   the  petitioner.\t The   order\nimpounding the passport of the petitioner was,\ntherefore, clearly in violation of the rule of\nnatural  justice\tembodied in the\t maxim\taudi\nalteram  partem and it was not  in  conformity\nwith the procedure prescribed by the\nPassports\nAct,  1967\n.  Realising that this was  a  fatal\ndefect  which would void the order  impounding\nthe passport, the learned Attomey-General made\na\t statement  on behalf of the  Government  of\nIndia to the following effect :\n\"1. The Government is agreeable to considering\nany  representation  that may be made  by\t the\npetitioner in respect of the impounding of her\npassport and giving her an opportunity in\t the\nmatter.  The opportunity will be, given within\ntwo    weeks   of\t  the\treceipt\t   of\t the\nrepresentation.\tIt is clarified that in\t the\npresent  case the grounds for  impounding\t the\npassport are those mentioned in the  affidavit\nin reply dated 18th August, 1977 of Shri Ghosh\nexcept those mentioned in para 2 (xi).\n2.The  representation  of\t the  petitioner\nwill be dealt with expeditiously in accordance\nwith law.\nThis  statement removes the voice from the order  impounding\nthe passport and it can no longer be assailed on the  ground\nthat it does not comply with the audi alteram partem rule or\nis.  not  in  accord with the procedure\t prescribed  by\t the\nPassports Act, 1967\n.\nIs\nSection 10(3) (c)\nviolative of\nArticle 14 ?\nThat takes us to the next question whether\nsection 10(3) (c)\nis  violative  of any of the fundamental  rights  guaranteed\nunder  Part III of the Constitution.  Only two\tarticles  of\nthe  Constitution are relied upon for this purpose and\tthey\nare\nArticles  14\nand\n19 (1) (a)\nand (g).   We\t will  first\ndispose of the challenge based on\nArticle 14\nas it lies in a\nvery  narrow  compass.\t The argument tinder  this  head  of\nchallenge, was that\n684\nsection\t 10(3) (c)\nconfers unguided and unfettered power  on\nthe Passport Authority to impound a passport and hence it is\nviolative  of the equality clause contained in\nArticle\t 14.\nIt  was conceded that under\nsection 10 (3) (c)\nthe power  to\nimpound a passport can be exercised only upon one or more of\nthe,  stated grounds, but the complaint was that the  ground\nof  \"interests\tof the general public\". was  too  vague\t and\nindefinite  to\tafford\tany real guidance  to  the  Passport\nAuthority  and the Passport Authority could, without in\t any\nway violating the terms of the section, impound the passport\nof one and not of another, at its discretion.  Moreover,  it\nwas  said that when the order impounding a passport is\tmade\nby  the Central Government, there is no appeal\tor  revision\nprovided  by  the Statute and the decision  of\tthe  Central\nGovernment  that  it  is in public  interest  to  impound  a\npassport is final and conclusive.  The discretion vested  in\nthe  Passport  Authority, and particularly  in\tthe  Central\nGovernment, is thus unfettered and unrestricted and this  is\nplainly\t in violation of\nArticle 14.\nNow, the law  is\twell\nsettled that when a statute vests unguided and\tunrestricted\npower  in  an  authority to affect the rights  of  a  person\nwithout\t laying\t down any policy or principle  which  is  to\nguide  the authority in exercise of this power, it would  be\naffected by the vice of discrimination since it would  leave\nit open to the Authority to discriminate between persons and\nthings similarly situated.  But here it is difficult to\t say\nthat  the discretion conferred on the Passport Authority  is\narbitrary or unfettered.  There are four grounds set out  in\nsection 10(3) (c)\nwhich would justify the making of an order\nimpounding a passport.\tWe are concerned only with the\tlast\nground denoted by the words \"in the interests of the general\npublic\",  for that is the ground which is attacked as  vague\nand indefinite.\t We fail to see how this ground can, by\t any\nstretch of argument, be characterised as vague or undefined.\nThe  words \"in the interests of the general public\"  have  a\nclearly well defined meaning and the courts have often\tbeen\ncalled upon to decide whether a particular action is \"in the\ninterests of the general public\" or in \"public interest\" and\nno difficulty has been experienced by the Courts in carrying\nout  this  exercise.   These  words  are  in  fact  borrowed\nipsissima verba from\nArticle 19(5)\nand we think it would  be\nnothing short of heresy to accuse the constitution makers of\nvague  and  loose  thinking.  The  legislature\tperformed  a\nscissor\t and paste operation in lifting these words  out  of\nArticle 19(5)\nand introducing them in\nsection 10(3) (c)\nand\nif  these  words  are not vague and  indefinite\t in\nArticle\n19(5)\n,\tit is difficult to see bow they can be condemned  to\nbe  such  when\tthey occur in\nsection 10(3)  (c)\n.   How\t can\nsection\t 10(3)\t(c)\nbe said  to  incur\t any  constitutional\ninfirmity  on account of these words when they are no  wider\nthan  the  constitutional  provision in\nArticle  19(5)\nand\nadhere\tloyally\t to  the  verbal  formula  adopted  In\t the\nConstitution  ? We are clearly of the view  that  sufficient\nguidelines  are provided by the, words \"in the interests  of\nthe general public\" and the power conferred on the  Passport\nAuthority  to  impound\ta  passport cannot  be\tsaid  to  be\nunguided  or  unfettered.  Moreover, it must  be  remembered\nthat the exercise of this power is not made dependent on the\nsubjective opinion of the Passport Authority as regards\t the\nnecessity  of  exercising it on one or more of\tthe  grounds\nstated\tin  the\t section,  but\tthe  Passport  Authority  is\nrequired to record in writing a brief statement of reasons\nfor impounding the passport and, save in cer-\n685\ntain  exceptional  circumstances, to supply a copy  of\tsuch\nstatement  to  the  person  affected,  so  that\t the  person\nconcerned  can\tchallenge  the\tdecision  of  the   Passport\nAuthority in appeal and the appellate authority can  examine\nwhether\t the  reasons given by the  Passport  Authority\t are\ncorrect,  and if so, whether they justify the making of\t the\norder  impounding  the passport.  It is true that  when\t the\norder\timpounding  a  passport\t is  made  by  the   Central\nGovernment,  there is no appeal against it, but it  must  be\nremembered that in such a case the power is exercised by the\nCentral Government itself and it can safely be assumed\tthat\nthe  Central  Government  will\texercise  the  power  in   a\nreasonable and responsible manner.  When power is vested  in\na high authority like the Central Government, abuse of power\ncannot\tbe lightly assumed.  And in any event, if  there  is\nabuse  of  power, the arms of the court are long  enough  to\nreach it and to strike it down.\t The power conferred on\t the\nPassport Authority to impound a passport under\nsection 10(3)\n(c) cannot, therefore, be regarded as discriminatory and  it\ndoes not fall foul of\nArticle 14.\nBut every exercise of such\npower  has to be tested in order to determine whether it  is\narbitrary or within the guidelines provided in\nSection 10(3)\n(c).\nConflicting  approaches for locating the  fundamental  right\nviolated Direct and Inevitable effect test.\nWe  think it would be proper at this stage to  consider\t the\napproach  to  be  adopted  by the  Court  in  adjudging\t the\nconstitutionality   of\ta  statute  on\tthe  touchstone\t  of\nfundamental  rights.   What is the test or yardstick  to  be\napplied\t for  determining  whether  a  statute\tinfringes  a\nparticular  fundamental\t right ? The law on this  point\t has\nundergone  radical change since the days of A. K.  Gopalan's\ncase.  That was the earliest' decision of this Court on\t the\nsubject, following almost immediately upon the\tcommencement\nof   the  Constitution.\t  The  argument\t which\t arose\t for\nconsideration in this case was that the preventive detention\norder  results in the detention of the applicant in  a\tcell\nand  hence it contravenes the fundamental rights  guaranteed\nunder  clauses\t(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g)\t of\nArticle\n19(1).\nThis  argument was negatived by Kania, C.  J.,\t who\npointed\t out that : \"The true approach is only\tto  consider\nthe  directness of the legislation and not what will be\t the\nresult of the detention, otherwise valid, on the mode of the\ndetenu's life-Any other construction put on the article-will\nbe  unreasonable\".   These  observations  were\tquoted\twith\napproval  by Patanjali Sastri, J; speaking on behalf of\t the\nmajority in\nRam Singh and Ors. v. State of Delhi\n(1).  There,\nthe detention of the petitioner was ordered with a view,  to\npreventing him from making. any speeches prejudicial to\t the\nmaintenance  of public order and the argument was  that\t the\norder of detention was invalid as it infringed the right  of\nfree  speech and expression guaranteed under\nArticle  19(1)\n(a).  The Court took the view that the direct object of\t the\norder  was preventive detention and not-the infringement  of\nthe  right  of freedom of speech and expression,  which\t was\nmerely\tconsequential upon the detention of the\t detenu\t and\nupheld\tthe  validity of the order.  The decision in\nA.  K.\nGopalan\n's  case, followed by\nRam Singh\n's case, gave rise  to\nthe  theory  that  the\tobject\tand  form  of  State  action\ndetermine the extent of protection which may be claimed\n(1)  [1951]S.C.R.451.\n686\nby  an individual and the validity of such action has to  be\njudged by considering whether it is \"directly in respect  of\nthe  subject  covered  by  any\tparticular  article  of\t the\nConstitution or touches the said article only  incidentially\nor indirectly\".\t The test to be applied for determining\t the\nconstitutional\tvalidity of State action with  reference  to\nfundamental rights is : what is the object of the  authority\nin  taking  the action : what is the subject-matter  of\t the\naction and to which fundamental right does it relate ?\tThis\ntheory\tthat  \"the extent of protection\t of  important\tgua-\nrantees,  such\tas  the\t liberty  of  person  and  right  to\nproperty,  depend  upon\t the form and object  of  the  State\naction\t and  not  upon\t its  direct  operation\t  upon\t the\nindividual's freedom\" held away for a considerable time\t and\nwas  applied in\nNaresh Shridhar Mirajkar & Ors. v. State  of\nMaharashtra  & Anr.\n(1) to sustain an order made by the\tHigh\nCourt  in a suit for defamation prohibiting the\t publication\nof  the evidence of a witness.\tThis Court, after  referring\nto  the observation of Kania, C.J., in A. K. Gopalan's\tcase\nand noting that they were approved by the Fill Court in\t Ram\nSingh's\t case, pointed out that the object of  the  impugned\norder  was  to give protection to the witness  in  order  to\nobtain\ttrue evidence in the case with a view to do  justice\nbetween\t the  parties  and it incidentally  it\toperated  to\nprevent the petitioner from reporting the proceedings of the\ncourt  in  the\tpress, it could not be\tsaid  to  contravene\nArticle 19(1) (a).\nBut it is interesting to note that despite the\tobservations\nof Kania, C.J., in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case and the approval  of\nthese  observations  in\nRam Singh\n's case,  there  were\t two\ndecisions  given  by this Court prior  to\nMirajkar\n's  case,\nwhich, seemed to deviate and strike, a different note.\nThe\nfirst  was  the decision in Express News Papers (P)  Ltd.  &\nAnr.  V. The Union of India & Ors.(2) where N. H.  Bhagwati,\nJ.,  speaking  on  behalf  of the  Court,  referred  to\t the\nobservations of Kania, C.J., in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case and the\ndecision in\nRain Singh\n's case, but ultimately formulated the\ntest of direct and inevitable effect for the purpose of\t ad-\njudging\t whether a statute offends a particular\t fundamental right.   The\nlearned  Judge\t pointed  out  that  all   the\nconsequences  suggested\t on behalf of  the  petitioner's  as\nflowing\t out  of  the  Working\tJournalists  (Conditions  of\nService) and Miscellaneous Act, 1955, namely, \"the  tendency\nto  curtail  circulation  and thereby narrow  the  scope  of\ndissemination  of information, fetters on  the\tpetitioners'\nfreedom\t to  choose  the  means\t of  exercising\t the  right,\nlikelihood of the independence of the press being undermined\nby having to seek government aid, the imposition of  penalty\non  the\t petitioners' right to choose  the  instruments\t for\nexercising   the   freedom  or\tcompelling  them   to\tseek\nalternative  media  etc.\", would be remote and\tdepend\tupon\nvarious\t factors  which\t may  or may  not  come\t into  play.\n\"Unless these were the direct or inevitable consequences  of\nthe measures enacted in the impugned Act\", said the  learned\nJudge,\t\"it  would  not\t be  possible  to  strike  down\t the\nlegislation as having that effect and operation.  A possible\neventuality  of\t this  type would  not\tnecessarily  he\t the\nconsequence  which  could  be in the  contemplation  of\t the\nLegislature  while enacting a measure of this type  for\t the\nbenefit of the\n(1)  [1966] 3 S.C.R. 744.\n(2)  [1959] S.C.R. 12.\n687\nworkmen\t concerned.\" Then again, the learned Judge  observed\nthe  intention or the proximate effect and operation of\t the\nAct  was such as to bring it within the mischief of\nArticle\n19(1)  (a)\n, it would certainly be liable to be struck  down.\nThe real difficulty, however, in the way of the\t petitioners\nis that neither the intention nor the effect and  ,operation\nof the impugned Act is to take away or abridge the right  of\nfreedom\t  of   speech\tand  expression\t  enjoyed   by\t the\npetitioners\".\tHere  we find the gern of  the\tdoctrine  of\ndirect\tand  inevitable effect, which  necessarily  must  be\neffect intended by the legislature, or in other words, 'what\nmay  conveniently  and\tappropriately be  described  as\t the\ndoctrine of    intended\t and real effect.  So also in\nSakal\nPapers (P) Ltd. & Ors. v.     The  Union of  India\n(1)  while\nconsidering the constitutional validity\t of  the\nNewspaper\n(Price\tand Page) Act, 1956\nand Daily Newspaper\t (Price\t and\nPage) Order, 1960, this Court applied the test of direct and\nimmediate effect.\nThis Court, relying upon the decision  in\nDwarkadas  Shrinivas v. The Sholapur & Weaving\tCo.  Ltd.\n(2)\npointed\t out  that \"it is the substance\t and  the  practical\nresult\tof  the act of the State that should  be  considered\nrather\tthan its purely legal aspect\" and \"the\tcorrect\t ap-\nproach\tin_such\t cases should be to enquire as\tto  what  in\nsubstance  is the loss or injury caused to the\tcitizen\t and\nnot  merely what manner and method has been adopted  by\t the\nState  in  placing the restriction.\" Since \"the\t direct\t and\nimmediate  effect  of  the order\" would\t be  to\t restrain  a\nnewspaper  from publishing any number of pages for  carrying\nits  news and views, which it has a fundamental right  under\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\nto do, unless it raises the selling price\nas  provided  in the Schedule to the Order, it was  held  by\nthis Court that the order was violative of the right of\t the\nnewspapers guaranteed by\nArticle 19(1) (a).\nHere again, the\nemphasis  was  on the direct and inevitable effect  ,of\t the\nimpugned  action of the State rather than on its object\t and\nform or subject-matter.\nHowever,  it was only R. C. Cooper's case that the  doctrine\nthat  the  ,object  and\t form  of  the\tState  action  alone\ndetermine the extent of protection that may be claimed by an\nindividual  and that the effect of the State action  on\t the\nfundamental  right  of\tthe individual\tis  irrelevant,\t was\nfinally rejected.  It may be pointed out that this  doctrine\nis  in sub-stance and reality nothing else than the test  of\npith  and  substance which is applied  for  determining\t the\nconstitutionality of legislation where there is conflict  of\nlegislative  powers  conferred on Federal and  State  Legis-\nlatures\t with reference to legislative Lists.  The  question\nwhich  is  asked  in such cases is : what is  the  pith\t and\nsubstance of the legislations; if it \"is within the  express\npowers,\t then  it  is not  invalidated\tif  incidentally  it\neffects\t matters  which are outside the\t authorised  field\".\nHere  also,  ,on  the  application  of\tthis  doctrine,\t the\nquestion that is required to be considered is : what is\t the\npith and substance of the action of the State, ,or in  other\nwords,\twhat is its true nature and character; if it  is  in\nrespect of the subject covered by any particular fundamental\nright, its validity must be judged only by reference to that\nfundamental right and it is immaterial that it\tincidentally\naffects another fundamental right.\n(1)  [1962] 3 S.C.R. 842.\n(2)  [1954] S.C.R.674.\n688\nMathew, J., in his dissenting judgment in\nBennett Coleman  &\nCo.  &\tOrs.  v. Union of India\t &  Ors.\n(1)  recognised\t the\nlikeness of this doctrine to the pith and substance test and\npointed out that \"the pith and substance test, although\t not\nstrictly  appropriate,\tmight  serve a\tuseful\tpurpose\"  in\ndetermining whether the State action infringes a  particular\nfundamental right.\nBut in R. C. Cooper's case, which was  a\ndecision  given\t by  the Full  Court  consisting  of  eleven\njudges,\t this  doctrine\t was thrown  overboard\tand  it\t was\npointed out by Shah, J.,, speaking on half of the majority :\n\"-it is not the object of the authority making\nthe law impairing the right of a citizen,\t nor\nthe   form  of  action  that  determines\t the\nprotection  he can claim; it is the effect  of\nthe law and of the action upon the right which\nattract the jurisdiction of the Court to grant\nrelief.\tIf  this be the true  view,  and  we\nthink  it\t is, in determining  the  impact  of\nState  action upon  constitutional  guarantees\nwhich  are  fundamental, it follows  that\t the\nextent  of protection against impairment of  a\nfundamental  right  is determined not  by\t the\nobject  of the Legislature nor by the form  of\nthe action , but by its direct operation\tupon\nthe individual's rights.\n\" we are of the view that the theory that\t the\nobject and form of the State action  determine\nthe  extent of protection which the  aggrieved\nparty  may  claim is not consistent  with\t the\nconstitutional scheme-\"\n\"In  our\tjudgment, the assumption  in  A.  K.\nGopalan's\t case; that certain articles in\t the\nConstitution  exclusively deal  with  specific\nmatters  and in determining whether  there  is\ninfringement  of the  individual's  guaranteed\nrights,  the object and the form of the  State\naction alone need be considered, and effect of\nthe laws on fundamental rights of the  indivi-\nduals  in\t general will be ignored  cannot  be\naccepted as correct.\"\nThe decision in R. C. Cooper's case thus overturned the view\ntaken  in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case and, as pointed out  by\tRay,\nJ., speaking on behalf of the majority in, Bennett Coleman's\ncase,it laid down two interrelated propositions, namely,\n\"First, it is not the object of the  authority\nmaking  the  law impairing the  right  of\t the\ncitizen nor the form of action that determines\nthe  invasion of the right.  Secondly,, it  is\nthe effect of the law and the action upon\t the\nright  which attracts the jurisdiction of\t the\nCourt  to grant relief.  The direct  operation\nof  the  Act upon the rights  forms  the\treal\ntest.\"\nThe decision in\nBennett Coleman\n's case, followed upon R.  C.\nCooper's  case\tand  it is'  an\t important  and\t significant\ndecision,  since it elaborated and applied the\tthesis\tlaid\ndown  in  R. C. Cooper's case.\nThe State action  which\t was\nimpugned in\nBennett Coleman\n's case was newsprint\n(1)  [1973] 2S.C.R.757.\n689\npolicy which inter alia imposed a maximum limit of ten pages\nfor every newspaper but without permitting the newspaper  to\nincrease the number of pages by reducing circulation to meet\nits  requirement  even within the admissible  quota.   These\nrestrictions were, said to be violative of the right of free\nspeech\tand  expression guaranteed under\nArticle  19(1)\t (a)\nsince their direct and inevitable consequence was to,  limit\nthe number of pages which could be published by a  newspaper\nto ten.\t The argument of the Government was that the, object\nof   the  newsprint  policy  was  rationing  and   equitable\ndistribution   of  imported  newsprint\twhich\twas   scarce\ncommodity  and\tnot  abridgement of freedom  of\t speech\t and\nexpression.   The  subject-matter of the import\t policy\t was\n\"rationing of imported commodity and equitable\tdistribution of newsprint\"\nand the newsprint policy did not directly and\nimmediately  deal with the right mentioned in\nArticle  19(1)\n(a) and hence there was no violation of that Article.\tThis\nargument of the Government was negatived by the majority  in\nthe following words :\n\"Mr.   Palkhivala said that the tests of\tpith\nand  substance  of the subject matter  and  of\ndirect   and  of\tincidental  effect  of\t the\nlegislation  are\trelevant  to  questions\t  of\nlegislative competence but they are irrelevant\nto the question of infringement of fundamental\nrights.\tIn  our\t view this is  a  sound\t and\ncorrect\tapproach   to\tinterpretation\t  of\nlegislative  measures  and  State\t action\t  in\nrelation to fundamental rights.  The true test\nis  whether the effect of the impugned  action\nis to take away or abridge fundamental rights.\nIf it be assumed that the direct object of the\nlaw or action has to be direct abridgement  of\nthe  right of free speech by the impugned\t law\nor   action  it  is  to  be  related  to\t the\ndirectness of effect and not to the directness\nof the, subject matter of the impeached law or\naction.\tThe action may have a direct  effect\non  a  fundamental right although\t its  direct\nsubject  matter  may  be\tdifferent.   A\t law\ndealing directly with the Defence of India  or\ndefamation may yet have a direct effect on the\nfreedom  of speech.\nArticle 19(2)\ncould\t not\nhave   such   law\t if   the   restriction\t  is\nunreasonable even if it is related to  matters\nmentioned\t  therein.   Therefore,\t  the\tword\n\"direct\" would go to the quality or  character\nof the effect and not to the subject  matter.\nThe  object of the law or executive action  is\nirrelevant    when    it\t  establishes\t the\npetitioner's  contention'\t about\t fundamental\nright.  In the present case, the object of the\nnewspaper restrictions has nothing to do\twith\nthe  availability\t of  newsprint\tor   foreign\nexchange because these restrictions come\tinto\noperation after the grant of quota.  Therefore\nthe restrictions are to control the number\tof\npages or circulation of dailies or newspapers.\nThese  restrictions  are clearly\toutside\t the\nambit  of\nArticle 19(2)\nof  the  Constitution.\nIt,  therefore,  confirms that  the  right  of\nfreedom  of speech and expression is  abridged\nby these restrictions\".\nThe majority took the view that it was not the object of the\nnewsprint   policy   or\t its  subject\tmatter\t which\t was\ndeterminative but its direct consequence or effect upon\t the\nrights of the newspapers and since \"the effect\n690\nand consequence of the impugned policy upon the\t newspapers\"\nwas direct control and restriction of growth and circulation\nof  newspapers,\t the newsprint policy infringed\t freedom  of\nspeech\tand  expression and was hence violative\t of\nArticle\n19(1) (a).\nThe pith and substance theory was thus negatived\nin the clearest terms and the test applied was as to what is\nthe  direct  and  inevitable consequence or  effect  of\t the\nimpugned  State\t action\t on the\t fundamental  right  of\t the\npetitioner.   It is possible that in a given case  the\tpith\nand substance of the State action may deal with a particular\nfundamental  right but its direct and inevitable effect\t may\nbe on another fundamental right and\nin that case\n, the  State\naction\twould  have  to meet the  challenge  of\t the  latter\nfundamental  right.  The pith and substance  doctrine  looks\nonly  at the object and subject-matter of the State  action,\nbut  in\t testing  the  validity of  the\t State\taction\twith\nreference  to  fundamental  rights,  what  the\tCourt\tmust\nconsider  is  the direct and inevitable consequence  of\t the\nState action.  Otherwise, the protection of the\t fundamental\nrights would be subtly but surely eroded.\nIt  may\t be  recalled  that the test  formulated  in  R.  C.\nCooper's case merely refers to 'direct operation' or 'direct\nconsequence   and  effect'  of\tthe  State  action  on\t the\nfundamental  right  of the petitioner and does not  use\t the\nword  'inevitable' in this connection.\tBut there can be  no\ndoubt,\ton a reading of the relevant observations  of  Shah,\nJ.,  that such was the test really intended to be laid\tdown\nby  the\t Court\tin that case.  If the test  were  merely  of\ndirect\tor indirect effect, it would be a openended  concept\nand  in\t the  absence of operational  criteria\tfor  judging\n'directness',  it  would give the  Court  an  unquantifiable\ndiscretion  to decide whether in a given case a\t consequence\nor  effect  is direct or not.\tSome  other  concept-vehicle\nwould  be  needed to quantify the extent  of  directness  or\nindirectness  in order to apply the test.\nAnd that is\tsup-\nplied by the criterion of 'inevitable' consequence or effect\nadumbrated in the\nExpress Newspaper\n's case.  This  criterion\nhelps  to  quantify the extent of  directness  necessary  to\nconstitute infringement of a fundamental right is direct and\ninevitable, then a fortiori it must be presumed to have been\nintended  by the authority taking the action and hence\tthis\ndoctrine of direct and inevitable effect has been  described\nby some jurists as the doctrine of intended and real effect.\nThis  is the test which must be applied for the\t purpose  of\ndetermining whether\nsection 10(3) (c)\nor the impugned  order\nmade under it is violative of\nArt. 19(1) (a)\nor (g).\nIs\nSection 10(3) (c)\nviolative of\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\nor\t (g)\n?\nWe may now examine the challenge based on\nArticle 19(1)\t (a)\nin  the\t light\tof  this  background.\nArticle\t 19(1)\t (a)\nenshrines one of the most cherished freedoms in a democracy,\nnamely,\t freedom of speech and expression.  The\t petitioner,\nbeing a citizen, has undoubtedly this freedom guaranteed  to\nher,  but the question is whether\nsection 10(3) (c)\nor\t the\nimpugned  Order\t unconstitutionally takes away\tor  abridges\nthis freedom.  Now, prima facie, the right, which is  sought\nto-be  restricted  by\nsection 10(3) (c)\nand  the  impugned\nOrder, is the right to go abroad and that is not named as  a\nfundamental  right or included in so many words\t in\nArticle\n19(1)  (a)\n, but the argument of the petitioner was that\t the\nright to go abroad is an integral part of the freedom of\n691\nspeech\tand expression and whenever State action, be it\t law\nor executive fiat, restricts or interferes with the right to\ngo abroad, it necessarily involves curtailment of freedom of\nspeech\tand expression, and is, therefore required  to\tmeet\nthe  challenge\tof\nArticle 19 (1) (a).\nThis  argument\t was\nsought\tto be answered by the Union of India by\t a  two-fold\ncontention.   The first limb of the contention was that\t the\nright to go abroad could not possibly be comprehended within\nfreedom of speech and expression, because the right of\tfree\nspeech and expression guaranteed under\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nwas\nexercisable  only  within  the territory of  India  and\t the\nguarantee  of  its  exercise did  not  extend  outside\tthe,\ncountry\t and  hence State action restricting  or  preventing\nexercise  of the right to go abroad could not be said to  be\nviolative of freedom of speech and expression and be  liable\nto be condemned as invalid on that account.  The second limb\nof  the contention went a little further and challenged\t the\nvery  premise  on which the argument of the  petitioner\t was\nbased and under this limb, the argument put forward was that\nthe right to go abroad was not integrally connected with the\nfreedom of speech and expression, nor did it partake of\t the\nsame  basic  nature  and  character and\t hence\tit  was\t not\nincluded  in  the  tight  of  free  speech  and\t  expression\nguaranteed  under\nArticle  19(1)  (a')\nand  imposition  of\nrestriction on it did not involve violation of that Article.\nThese were broadly the rival contentions urged on behalf  of\nthe parties and we shall now proceed to consider them.\n(A)  Is\t Freedom  of speech and expression confined  to\t the\nTerritory of India ?\nThe  first question that arises for consideration  on  these\ncontentions  is\t as to what is the scope and  ambit  of\t the\nright of free speech and expression conferred under\nArticle\n19(1)  (a).\nHas it any geographical limitations ?  Is\t its\nexercise  guaranteed only within the territory of  India  or\ndoes  it also extend outside ? The Union of India  contended\nthat  it was a basic postulate of the Constitution that\t the\nfundamental  rights  guaranteed by it  were  available\tonly\nwithin the territory of India, for it could never have\tbeen\nthe  intention of the constitution-makers to  confer  rights\nwhich  the  authority of the State could not  enforce.\t The\nargument  was stressed in the form of an interrogation;\t how\ncould  the  fundamental rights be intended to  be  operative\noutside\t the  territory\t of India  when\t their\texercise  in\nforeign territory could not be protected by the State ? Were\nthe fundamental rights intended to be mere platitudes. in so\nfar  as territory outside India is concerned ? What was\t the\nobject\tof  conferring the guarantee of\t fundamental  rights\noutside\t the territory of India, if it could not be  carried\nout  by- the State ? This argument, plausible though it\t may\nseem  at  first blush, is, on closer scrutiny,\tunsound\t and\nmust be rejected.  When the constitution-makers enacted Part\nIII  dealing with fundamental rights, they inscribed in\t the\nConstitution  certain  basic rights which  inhere  in  every\nhuman  being  and  which are essential\tfor  unfoldment\t and\ndevelopment of his full personality.  These rights represent\nthe   basic   values  of  a  civilised\t society   and\t the\nconstitution-makers  declared  that they shall\tbe  given  a\nplace  of  pride  in the Constitution and  elevated  to\t the\nstatus of fundamental rights.\n692\nThe  long  years  of the freedom struggle  inspired  by\t the\ndynamic\t spiritualism  of  Mahatma Gandhi and  in  fact\t the\nentire\tcultural and spiritual history of India formed,\t the\nbackground  against  which  these rights  were\tenacted\t and\nconsequently, these rights were, conceived by the  constitu-\ntion-makers  not  in  a narrow limited sense  but  in  their\nwidest\tsweep, for the aim and objective was to build a\t new\nsocial\torder where man will not be a mere plaything in\t the\nhands  of  the State or a few privileged persons  but  there\nwill  be full scope and opportunity for him to\tachieve\t the\nmaximum\t development of his personality and the\t dignity  of\nthe  individual\t will be fully assured.\t  The  constitution-\nmakers\trecognised the spiritual dimension of man  and\tthey\nwere  conscious that he is an embodiment of  divinity,\twhat\nthe  great Upnishadnic verse describes as \"the\tchildren  of\nimmortality\"  and  his\tmission in life is  to\trealise\t the\nultimate truth.\t This obviously he cannot achieve unless  he\nhas  certain  basic freedoms, such as  freedom\tof  thought,\nfreedom\t of  conscience, freedom of speech  and\t expression,\npersonal  liberty  to move where he likes and so on  and  so\nforth.\t It was this vast conception of man in\tsociety\t and\nuniverse that animated the formulation of fundamental rights\nand it is difficult to believe that when the  constitution-\nmakers, declared these rights, they intended to confine them\nonly  within  the  territory of India.\t Take  for  example,\nfreedom\t of  speech  and expression.   Could  it  have\tbeen\nintended  by the constitution-makers that a  citizen  should\nhive  this  freedom in India but not outside  ?\t Freedom  of\nspeech\tand expression carries with it the right  to  gather\ninformation  as also, to speak and express oneself  at\thome\nand  abroad and to, exchange thoughts and ideas with  others\nnot  only in India but also outside.  On what  principle  of\nconstruction  and  for\twhat  reason  can  this\t freedom  be\nconfined  geographically  within the limits of India  ?\t The\nconstitution-makers  have not chosen to limit the extent  of\nthis freedom by adding the words \"in the territory of India\"\nat  the\t end of\nArticle 19(1) (a).\nThey  have\tdeliberately\nrefrained from using any words of limitation.  Then, are  we\ngoing  to supply these words and narrow down the  scope\t and\nambit  of a highly cherished fundamental right ? Let us\t not\nforget\tthat  what we are expounding is a  constitution\t and\nwhat  we  are  called  upon  to\t interpret  is\ta  provision\nconferring a, fundamental right.  Shall we expand its  reach\nand ambit or curtail it ? Shall we ignore the high and noble\npurpose of Part III conferring fundamental rights ? Would we\nnot be stultifying the fundamental right of free speech\t and\nexpression  by\trestricting it\tby  territorial\t limitation.\nMoreover, it may be noted that only a short while before the\nConstitution   was  brought  into  force  and\twhilst\t the\nconstitutional\tdebate\twas still going\t on,  the  Universal\nDeclaration  of\t Human\tRights was adopted  by\tthe  General\nAssembly  of the United Nations on 10th December, 1948 and\nmost  of  the fundamental rights which we find\tincluded  in\nPart  III were recognised and adopted by the United  Nations\nas   the  inalienable  rights  of  man\tin   the   Universal\nDeclaration  of Human Rights.\nArticle 19\nof  the  Universal\nDeclaration declared that \"every one, has a right to freedom\nof  opinion and expression, this right includes\t freedom  to\nhold opinions without interference and to seek, receive\t and\nimport\t information  and  ideas  through  any\t media\t and\nregardless of frontiers\". (emphasis supplied).\tThis was the\nglorious  declaration of the: fundamental freedom of  speech\nand  expression noble in conception and universal in  scope-\nwhich was\n693\nbefore them when the constitution-makers enacted\nArticle  19\n(1)  (a).\nWe\thave, therefore, no doubt  that\t freedom  of\nspeech\tand  expression guaranteed by\nArticle 19(1)  (a)\nis\nexercisable not only in India but outside.\nIt  is\ttrue that the right of free  speech  and  expression\nenshrined  in\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\ncan be enforced only if  it\nsought\tto be violated by any action of the State and  since\nState  action cannot have any extra  territorial  operation,\nexcept\t perhaps  incidentally\tin  case  of   Parliamentary\nlegislation,  it is only violation within the  territory  of\nIndia that can be complained of by an aggrieved person.\t But\nthat  does  not\t mean  that the right  of  free\t speech\t and\nexpression  is\texercisable only in India and  not  outside.\nState action taken within the territory of India can prevent\nor  restrict  exercise of freedom of speech  and  expression\noutside\t India.\t What\nArticle 19(1) (a)\ndoes is\t to  declare\nfreedom of speech and expression as a fundamental right\t and\nto protect it against State action.  The State cannot by any\nlegislative or executive, action interfere with the exercise\nof this right, except in so far as permissible under\nArticle\n19(2).\nThe State action would necessarily be taken in India\nbut  it\t may impair or restrict the exercise of\t this  right\nelsewhere.   Take for example a case where a  journalist  is\nprevented  by a law or an executive order from\tsending\t his\ndespatch  abroad.   The law or the  ,executive\torder  would\noperate\t on  the,  journalist in India\tbut  what  it  would\nprevent him from doing is to exercise his freedom of  speech\nand  expression\t abroad.   Today in the\t modern\t world\twith\nvastly developed science and technology and highly  improved\nand  sophisticated means of communication, a person  may  be\nable to exercise freedom of speech and expression abroad  by\ndoing something within the country and if this is  published\nor  restricted, his freedom of speech and  expression  would\ncertainly  be  impaired\t and\nArticle 19\t (1)  (a)\nviolated.\nTherefore, merely because State action is restricted to\t the\nterritory of India, it does not necessarily follow that\t the\nright  of free speech and expression is also limited in\t its\noperation  to  the territory of India and  does\t not  extend\noutside.\nThis  thesis  can also be substantiated by  looking  at\t the\nquestion  from\ta slightly different point of view.   It  is\nobvious\t that  the  right  of  free  speech  and  expression\nguaranteed  under\nArticle  19(1) (a)\ncan  be  subjected  to\nrestriction permissible under\nArticle 19(2).\nSuch  restric-\ntion,  imposed\tby a statute or an order made under  it,  if\nwithin\tthe limits provided in\nArticle 19(2)\n, would  clearly\nbind the citizen not only when he is within the country\t but\nalso  when  he\ttravels outside.  Take for  example  a\tcase\nwhere,\teither\tunder  the\nPassports Act,  1967\n,or  as  a\ncondition  in  the Passport issued under it,  an  arbitrary,\nunreasonable and wholly unjustifiable restriction is  placed\nupon  the citizen that he may go abroad, but he\t should\t not\nmake any speech there.\tThis would plainly be a\t restriction\nwhich  would  interfere\t with  his  freedom  of\t speech\t and\nexpression outside the country, for, if valid, it would bind\nhim  wherever he may go.  He would be entitled to  say\tthat\nsuch a restriction imposed by State action is  impermissible\nunder\nArticle\t19(2)\nand  is\taccordingly  void  as  being\nviolative of\nArticle 19(1 )(a)\n6-119\nSCI/78\n694\nIt  would  thus\t seem  clear  that  freedom  of\t speech\t and\nexpression guaranteed under\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nis exercisable\nnot only inside the country, but also outside.\nThere is also another consideration which leads to the\tsame\nconclusion.   The right to go abroad is, as held in  Satwant\nSingh  Sawhney's case, included in personal liberty'  within\nthe  meaning of\nArticle 21\nand is thus a  fundamental  right\nprotected by that Article.  When the State issues a passport\nand  grants  endorsement for one country,  but\trefuses\t for\nanother, the person concerned can certainly go out of  India\nbut he is prevented from going to the country for which\t the\nendorsement  is refused and his right to go to that  country\nis  taken  away.   This cannot be done by  the\tState  under\nArticle 21\nunless there is a law authorising the State to do\nso and the action is taken in accordance with the  procedure\nprescribed  by\tsuch law.  The right to, go abroad,  and  in\nparticular  to\ta  specified country, is  clearly  right  to\npersonal  liberty exercisable outs de India and yet  it\t has\nbeen   held  in\t Satwant  Singh\t Sawhney's  case  to  be   a\nfundamental  right  protected by\nArticle  21.\nThis  clearly\nshows\tthat  there  is\t no  underlying\t principle  in\t the\nConstitution  which limits the fundamental rights  in  their\noperation to the territory of India.  If a fundamental right\nunder\nArticle 21\ncan be exercisable outside India, why\t can\nfreedom\t of  speech and expression conferred  under\nArticle\n19(1) (a)\nbe not so exercisable ?\nThis  view which we are taking is completely in accord\twith\nthe thinking on the subject in the United States.  There the\npreponderance of opinion is that the, protection of the Bill\nof  Rights  is available to United States citizens  even  in\nforeign countries.  Vide Best v. United States(1).   There\nis  an interesting article on \"The Constitutional  Right  to\nTravel\" in 1956 Columbia Law Review where Leonard B.  Boudin\nwrites :\n\"The  final objection to limitation  upon\t the\nright  to travel in that they  interfere\twith\nthe,   individual's  freedom  of\t expression.\nTravel itself is such a freedom in the view of\none scholarly jurist.  But we need not go that\nfar;  it is enoughthat the freedom  of  speech\nincludes the right of Americans to exercise it\nanywhere\twithout\t the interference  of  their\ngovernment.    There   are   no\tgeographical\nlimitations   to\tthe  Bill  of\tRights.\t   A\nGovernment  that\tsets  up  barriers  to\t its\ncitizens' freedom of expression in any country\nin the world violates the Constitution as much\nas  if  it  enjoined such\t expression  in\t the\nUnited States.\"\nThese  observations were quoted with approval by Hegde,\t J.,\n(as  he then was) speaking on behalf of a Division Bench  of\nthe  Karnataka\tHigh Court in\nDr. S.  S.  Sadashiva  Rao  v.\nUnion  of India\n(2) and the learned Judge there\tpointed\t out\nthat  \"these  observations  apply  in  equal  force  to\t the\nconditions  prevailing\tin  this country\".  it\tis  obvious,\ntherefore,  that  there are no geographical  limitations  to\nfreedom\t of speech and expression guaranteed  Under\nArticle\n19(1) (a)\nand this freedom is exercisable not only in  India\nbut also outside and if State\n(1)  184 Federal Reporter (2d)131.\n(2)  1965 Mysore Law Journal, P.605.\n695\naction\tsets  up  barriers  to\tits  citizen's\tfreedom\t  of\nexpression  in\tany country in the world, it  would  violate\nArticle\t 19(1)\t(a)\nas\t much  as  if  ,it  inhibited\tsuch\nexpression  within the country.\t This conclusion would on  a\nparity\tof  reasoning  apply  equally  in  relation  to\t the\nfundamental right to practice any profession or to carry any\noccupation, trade or business guaranteed under\nArticle 19(1)\n(g).\n(B)  Is the right to go abroad covered by\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\nor (g) ?\nThat  takes  us\t to the next question arising  out  of\t the\nsecond\tlimb  of the contention of the Government.   Is\t the\nright  to go abroad an essential part of freedom  of  speech\nand  expression so that whenever there is violation  of\t the\nformer,\t  there\t is  impairment\t of  the  latter   involving\ninfraction  of\nArticle\t 19 (1) (a)?\nThe  argument  of\t the\npetitioner  was that while it is true that the right  to  go\nabroad\tis not expressly included as a fundamental right  in\nany  of\t the  clauses of\nArticle  19(1)\n,  its  existence  is\nnecessary in order to make the express freedoms mentioned in\nArticle\t 19(1)\nmeaningful and effective.  The right of\tfree\nspeech\tand expression can have meaningful content  and\t its\nexercise can be effective only if the right to travel abroad\nis ensured and without it, freedom of speech and  expression\nwould\tbe   limited  by  geographical\t constraints.\t The\nimpounding  of\tthe  passport of a person  with\t a  view  to\npreventing him from going abroad to communicate his ideas or\nshare  his  thoughts  and views with others  or\t to  express\nhimself\t through song or dance or other forms and  media  of\nexpression is direct interference with freedom of speech and\nexpression.   It  is clear, so ran the argument, that  in  a\ncomplex\t  and  developing  society,  where  fast  modes\t  of\ntransport and communication have narrowed down distances and\nbrought\t people\t living\t in different  parts  of  the  world\ntogether, the right to associate with like minded persons in\nother  parts  of  the globe, for the  purpose  of  advancing\nsocial,\t  political   or  other\t ideas\t and   policies\t  is\nindispensable  and  that is part of freedom  of\t speech\t and\nexpression  which cannot be effectively implemented  without\nthe  right  to go abroad.  The right to go  abroad,  it\t was\nsaid,  is  a peripheral right emanating from  the  right  to\nfreedom of speech and expression and is, therefore,  covered\nby\nArticle 19(1) (a).\nThis argument of the petitioner\t was\nsought to be supported by reference to some recent decisions\nof the Supreme Court of the United States.  We shall examine\nthese  decisions a little later, but let us  first  consider\nthe question on principle.\nWe  may\t begin\tthe discussion of  this\t question  by  first\nconsidering  the nature and significance of the right to  go\nabroad.\t  It  cannot  be disputed that there  must  exist  a\nbasically free sphere for man, resulting from the nature and\ndignity\t of  the human being as the bearer  of\tthe  highest\nspiritual and moral values.  This basic freedom of the human\nbeing  is  expressed at various levels and is  reflected  in\nvarious\t basic rights.\tFreedom to go abroad is one of\tsuch\nrights,\t for the nature of man is a free  agent\t necessarily\ninvolves free movement on his part.  There, can be no  doubt\nthat if the purpose and the sense of the State is to protect\npersonality  and its development, as indeed it should be  of\nany  liberal democratic State, freedom to go abroad must  be\ngiven its due place amongst the basic rights.  This right is\nan important basic\n696\nhuman\tright  for  it\tnourishes  independent\t and   self-\ndetermining  creative character of the individual, not\tonly\nby  extending his freedoms of action, but also by  extending\nthe  scope  of his experience.\tIt is a\t right\twhich  gives\nintellectual and creative workers in particular the opportu-\nnity  of extending their spiritual and intellectual  horizon\nthrough study at foreign universities, through contact\twith\nforeign colleagues and through participation in\t discussions\nand  conferences.  The right also extends to private life  :\nmarriage, family and friendship are humanities which can  be\nrarely affected through refusal of freedom to go abroad\t and\nclearly\t show  that this freedom is a genuine  human  right.\nMoreover, this freedom would be highly valuable right  where\nman  finds himself obliged to flee (a) because he is  unable\nto  serve  his\tGod as he wished at the\t previous  place  of\nresidence,  (b) because his personal freedom  is  threatened\nfor  reasons  which do not constitute a crime in  the  usual\nmeaning\t of  the word and many were such  cases\t during\t the\nemergency, or (c) because his life is threatened either\t for\nreligious or political reasons or through the threat to\t the\nmaintenance  of minimum standard of living  compatible\twith\nhuman  dignity.\t These, reasons suggest that freedom  to  go\nabroad\tincorporates  the important function of\t an  ultimum\nrefunium  libertatis when other basic freedoms are  refused.\nTo,  quote  the\t words of Mr. Justice  Douglas\tin  Kent  v.\nDulles(1)  freedom  to go abroad has much social  value\t and\nrepresents a basic human right of great significance.  It is\nin  fact  incorporated\tas an  inalienable  human  right  in\nArticle\t 13\nof the Universal Declaration of  Human  Rights.\nBut  it is not specifically named as a fundamental right  in\nArticle 19(1).\nDoes it mean that on that account it  cannot\nbe a fundamental right covered by\nArticle 19(1) ?\nNow, it may be pointed out at the outset that it is not\t our\nview  that  a right which is not specifically  mentioned  by\nname can never be a fundamental right within the meaning  of\nArticle\t 19(1).\nIt is possible that a right does  not\tfind\nexpress\t mention in any clause of\nArticle 19(1)\nand  yet  it\nmay  be\t covered by some clause of that Article.   Take\t for\nexample, by way of illustration, freedom of press.  It is  a\nmost  cherished and valued freedom in a democracy  :  indeed\ndemocracy cannot survive without a free press.\tDemocracy is\nbased  essentially on free debate and open  discussion,\t for\nthat  is  the only corrective of Governmental  action  in  a\ndemocratic  set\t up.  If democracy means government  of\t the\npeople by the people, it is obvious that every citizen\tmust\nbe entitled to participate in the democratic process and  in\norder  to enable him to intelligently exercise his right  of\nmaking\ta  choice, free and general  discussion\t of  public\nmatters\t is absolutely essential.  Manifestly,\tfree  debate\nand open discussion, in the most comprehensive sense, is not\npossible  unless  there\t is a free  and\t independent  press.\nIndeed\tthe  true  measure of the health  and  vigour  of  a\ndemocracy  is always to be found in its press.\tLook at\t its\nnewspapers-do they reflect diversity of opinions and  views,\ndo they contain expression of dissent and criticism  against\ngovernmental  policies and actions, or do they\tobsequiously\nsing  the praises of the government or lionize or deify\t the\nruler.\t The newspapers are the index of the true  character\nof the Government-whether if is democratic or authoritarian.\nIt was\n(1)  357 U.\nS. 11\n6\n: 2 L. ed. 2d 1204.\n697\nMr.  Justice Potter Stewart who said : \"Without an  informed\nand  free  press, there cannot be  an  enlightened  people\".\nThus freedom of the press constitutes one of the pillars  of\ndemocracy  and indeed lies at the foundation  of  democratic\nOrganisation  and yet it is not enumerated in so many  terms\nas  a fundamental right in\nArticle 19(1)\n, though there is  a\nview  held by some constitutional jurists that this  freedom\nis too basic and fundamental not to receive express  mention\nin  Part III of the Constitution.  But it has been  held  by\nthis  Court  in several decisions, of which we\tmay  mention\nonly   three,  namely,\nExpress\t Newspapers\n'   case,\nSakal\nNewspapers\ncase  and  Bennett Coleman\t&  Co's\t case,\tthat\nfreedom of the press is part of the right of free speech and\nexpression  and\t is  covered by\nArticle 19  (1)\t (a).\nThe,\nreason is that freedom of the press is nothing but an aspect\nof  freedom  of speech and expression.\tIt partakes  of\t the\nsame  basic nature and character and is indeed\tan  integral\npart of free speech and expression and perhaps it would\t not\nbe incorrect to say that it is the same right applicable  in\nrelation  to the press.\t So also, freedom of circulation  is\nnecessarily involved in freedom of speech and expression and\nis  part  of it and hence enjoys the protection\t of\nArticle\n19(1)  (a).\nVide  Ramesh Thappar  v.  State  of  Madras\n(1).\nSimilarly,  the right to paint or sing or dance or to  write\npoetry\tor literature is also covered by\nArticle 19(1)\t(a)\n,\nbecause\t the  common  basic  characteristic  in\t all   these\nactivities is freedom of speech and expression, or to put it\ndifferently,  each  of these activities is  an\texercise  of\nfreedom\t of  speech and expression.  It would thus  be\tseen\nthat  even if a right is not specifically named\t in\nArticle\n19(1)\n,\tit may still be a fundamental right covered by\tsome\nclause of that Article, if it is an integral part of a named\nfundamental  right or partakes of the same basic nature\t and\ncharacter as that fundamental right.  It is not enough\tthat\na  right claimed by the petitioner flows or emanates from  a\nnamed  fwidamental right or that its existence is  necessary\nin order to make the exercise of the named fundamental right\nmeaningful and effective.  Every activity which\t facilitates\nthe exercise of a named fundamental right is not necessarily\ncomprehended  in  that\tfundamental  right  nor\t can  it  be\nregarded  as  such merely because it may  not  be  possible,\notherwise  to effectively exercise, that fundamental  right.\nThe contrary construction would lead to incongruous  results\nand  the  entire  scheme  of\nArticle  19(1)\nwhich  confers\ndifferent   rights  and\t sanctions  different\trestrictions\naccording to different standards depending upon. the nature,\nof  the right will be upset.  What is necessary to  be\tseen\nis, and that is the test which must be applied, whether\t the\nright  claimed\tby the petitioner is an integral part  of  a\nnamed fundamental right or partakes of the same basic nature\nand  character as the named fundamental right so  that\tthe\nexercise  of such right is in reality and substance  nothing\nbut  an\t instance of the exercise of the  named\t fundamental\nright.\tIf this be the correct test, as we apprehend it\t is.\nthe  right  to,\t go abroad cannot in  all  circumstances  be\nregarded  as included in freedom of speech  and\t expression.\nMr. Justice Douglas said in Kent v. Dulles that \"freedom  of\nmovement  across frontiers in either direction,\t and  inside\nfrontiers  as  well,  was a part of  our  heritage.   Travel\nabroad. like travel within the country, ay be necessary\t for\nlivelihood.   It  may  be  as close  to\t the  heart  of\t the\nindividual as the choice of what he eats,\n(1)  [1950] S.C.R. 594.\n698\nor  wears,  or reads.  Freedom of movement is basic  in\t our\nScheme\tof  values.\"  And what the learned  Judge,  said  in\nregard\tto freedom of movement in his country holds good  in\nour country as well.  Freedom of movement has been a part of\nour ancient tradition which always upheld the dignity of man\nand  saw  in him the embodiment of the\tDivine.\t  The  Vedic\nseers  knew no limitations either in the locomotion  of\t the\nhuman body or in the flight of the soul to higher planes  of\nconsciousness.\tEven in the post-Upnishadic period, followed\nby the Buddhistic era and the early centuries after  Christ,\nthe people of this country went to foreign lands in  pursuit\nof  trade and business or in search of knowledge or  with  a\nview  to shedding on others the light of knowledge  imparted\nto  them by their ancient sages and seers.   India  expanded\noutside\t her  borders: her ships crossed the ocean  and\t the\nfine  superfluity of her wealth brimmed over to the East  as\nwell  as  to the West.\tHe cultural  messengers\t and  envoys\nspread\ther  arts  and\tepics in South\tEast  Asia  and\t her\nreligious  conquered China and Japan and other\tFar  Eastern\ncountries  and\tspread\twestward as  far  as  Palestine\t and\nAlexendria.   Even at the end of the last and the  beginning\nof  the present century, our people sailed across the seas\nto  settle  down  in  the  African  countries.\t Freedom  of\nmovement  at home and abroad is a part of our heritage\tand,\nas  already  pointed  out, it is a  highly  cherished  right\nessential  to  the  growth  and\t development  of  the  human\npersonality  and its importance cannot be  over\t emphasised.\nBut it cannot be said to be part of the right of free speech\nand  expression.   It is not of the same  basic\t nature\t and\ncharacter  as  freedom\tof speech and  expression.   When  a\nperson\tgoes abroad, he may do so for a variety\t of  reasons\nand  it\t may not necessarily and always be for\texercise  of\nfreedom\t of speech and expression.  Every travel  abroad  is\nnot  an exercise of right of free speech and expression\t and\nit  would  not be correct to say that whenever\tthere  is  a\nrestriction  on\t the right to go abroad,  ex  necessitae  it\ninvolves violation of freedom of speech and expression.\t  It\nis  no\tdoubt true that going abroad may be necessary  in  a\ngiven case for exercise of freedom of speech and expression,\nbut  that does not make it an integral part of the right  of\nfree  speech  and expression.  Every activity  that  may  be\nnecessary  for exercise of freedom of speech and  expression\nor  that may facilitate such exercise or make it  meaningful\nand  effective\tcannot\tbe  elevated  to  the  status  of  a\nfundamental  right  as if it were part\tof  the\t fundamental\nright of free speech and expression.  Otherwise, practically\nevery  activity would become part of some fundamental  right\nor  the other and. the object of making certain rights\tonly\nas    fundamental   rights   with   different\t permissible\nrestrictions would be frustrated.\nThe  petitioner,  however, placed very\tstrong\treliance  on\ncertain\t decisions of the United States Supreme Court.\t The\nfirst  was  the\t decision in Kent v.  Dulles  (supra).\t The\nSupreme\t Court\tlaid  down in this case that  the  right  to\ntravel\tis guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and  held\tthat\nthe denial of passport by the Secretary of State was invalid\nbecause the Congress had not, under the\nPassport Act,  1926\n,\nauthorised the Secretary of State to refuse passport on\t the\nground\tof association with the communist party and  refusal\nto  file an affidavit relating to that affiliation and\tsuch\nlegislation was necessary before the Secretary of\n699\nState could refuse passport on those grounds.  This decision\nwas  not  concerned  with the validity\tof  any\t legislation\nregulating issue of passports nor did it recognise the right\nto  travel as founded on the first Amendment which  protects\nfreedom\t of speech, petition and assembly.  We fail  to\t see\nhow this decision can be of any, help to the petitioner.\nThe  second decision on which reliance was placed on  behalf\nof  the\t petitioner was Apthekar v. Secretary  of  State(1).\nThe  question Which arose for determination in\tthis  case\nrelated to the constitutional validity 'of section 6 of\t the\nSubversive  Activities\tControl\t Act,  1950.   This  section\nprohibited  the use of passports by communists\tfollowing  a\nfinal  registration  order  by\tthe  Subversive\t  Activities\nControl\t Board under\nsection 7\nand following the mandate  of\nthis  section,\tthe State Department  revoked  the  existing\npassports   of\t the  appellants.   After   exhausting\t all\nadministrative remedies, the appellants sued for declarative\nand injunctive relief before the District Court which upheld\nthe validity of the section.  On direct appeal, the  Supreme\nCourt  reversed\t the judgment by a majority of\tsix  against\nthree,\tand  held the section to be  invalid.\tThe  Supreme\nCourt  noted  first that the right to travel  abroad  is  an\nimportant aspect of the citizens' liberty guaranteed by\t the\nDue  Process  Clause of the Fifth Amendment  and\nsection  6\nsubstantially  restricts  that right and then  proceeded  to\napply  the strict standard of judicial review which  it\t had\ntill  then  applied  only in cases  involving  the  socalled\npreferred  freedoms of the first Amendment, namely, that  \"a\ngovernmental  purpose-may  not be achieved  by\tmeans  which\nsweep  unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area  of\nprotected freedoms\".  The Supreme Court found on application\nof  this  test\tthat  the  section  was\t \"overly  broad\t and\nunconstitutional   on  its  face\"  since  it   omitted\t any\nrequirement that the individual should have knowledge of the\norganisational\t  purpose   to\t establish    a\t   communist\ntotaliatarian dictatorship and it made no attempt to  relate\nthe restriction on travel to the individual's purpose of the\ntrip  or  to  the  scurity-sensitivity of  the\tarea  to  be\nvisited.   This\t decision  again has  no  relevance  to\t the\npresent\t argument  except for one observation  made  by\t the\nCourt  that \"freedom of travel is a  constitutional  liberty\nclosely\t related to rights of free speech and  association\".\nBut  this observation also cannot help because the right  to\nforeign travel was held to be a right arising not out of the\nfirst  Amendment  but  inferentially  out  of  the   liberty\nguaranteed  in the Fifth Amendment and this observation\t was\nmeant  only  to\t support the \"tension of  the  strict  First\nAmendment test to a case involving the right to go abroad.\nThe  last  decision cited by the petitioner Was Zemel  .  v.\nRusk 2) This case raised the question whether the  Secretary\nof  State was statutorily authorised to refuse\tto  validate\nthe  passports of United States citizens for travel to\tCuba\nand  if\t so,  whether the exercise  of\tsuch  authority\t was\nconstitutionally  permissible.\tThe Court, by a majority  of\nsix  against three, held that the ban on travel to Cuba\t was\nauthorised  by the broad language of the\nPassport Act,\t1926\nand  that  such\t a restriction\twas  constitutional.   Chief\nJustice Warren speaking on behalf of\n(1)  378 U. S. 500 :12 L. ed. 2d 992.\n(2)  381 U.\nS. 1\n: 14 L. ed. 2d 179.\n700\nthe  majority observed that having regard to  administrative\npractice both before and after 1926, area restrictions\twere\nstatutorily  authorised and that necessitated  consideration\nof Zemel's constitutional objections.  The majority took the\nview  that freedom of movement was a right protected by\t the\n'liberty'  clause  of  the  Fifth  Amendment  and  that\t the\nSecretary  of  State was justified in  attempting  to  avoid\nserious\t international\tincidents by restricting  travel  to\nCuba  and  summarily rejected Zemel's  contention  that\t the\npassport  denial  infringed his First  Amendment  rights  by\npreventing  him\t from gathering first band  knowledge  about\nCuban  situation.  Kent v. Dulles and Aptheker v.  Secretary\nof State were distinguished on the, ground that \"the refusal\nto,  validate appellant's passport does not result from\t any\nexpression  or\tassociation on his part : appellant  is\t not\nbeing forced to choose between membership of an Organisation\nand  freedom  to travel\".  Justices, Douglas,  Goldberg\t and\nBlack  dissented in separate opinions.\tSince  reliance\t was\nplaced\tonly  on  the opinion of  Justice  Douglas,  we\t may\nconfine\t our  attention to that\t opinion.   Justice  Douglas\nfollowed  the  approach\t employed in  Kent  v.\tDulles\tand,\nrefused to interpret the, Pass.port Act, 1926 as  permitting\nthe  Secretary of State to restrict travel to  Cuba.   While\ndoing so, the learned Judge stressed the relationship of the\nright to travel to First Amendment rights.  He pointed out :\n\"The right to know, to converse with others, to consult with\nthem,  to  observe  social, physical,  political  and  other\nphenomena  abroad  as  well as at  home\t gives\tmeaning\t and\nsubstance to freedom of expression and freedom of the press.\nWithout\t these contacts First Amendment rights suffer\",\t and\nadded  that freedom to travel abroad is a right\t \"peripheral\nto  the\t enjoyment of the First Amendment  guarantees\".\t  He\nconcluded  by observing that \"the right to travel is at\t the\nperiphery   of\t the   First   Amendment\"   and\t   therefore\n\"restrictions  on  the\tright to travel in  times  of  peace\nshould be so particularised that a First Amendment right  is\nnot  thereby  precluded\".   Now,  obviously,  the   majority\ndecision  is  of- no help to the petitioner.   The  majority\nrightly\t pointed out that in Kent v. Dulles and Aptheker  v.\nSecretary  of  State  there  was  direct  interference\twith\nfreedom of association by refusal to validate the  passport,\nsince  the appellant was required to give up  membership  of\nthe  Organisation if he wanted validation of  the  passport.\nSuch was not the case in zemel v. Rusk and that is why, said\nthe  majority it was not a First Amendment right  which\t was\ninvolved.   It\tappeared  clearly to be\t the  view  of\tthe,\nmajority  that if the denial of passport directly affects  a\nFirst  Amendment  right\t such as freedom  of  expression  or\nassociation  as in Kent v. Dulles and Aptheker v.  Secretary\nof  State,  it\twould  be  constitutionally  invalid.\t The\nmajority  did  not accept the contention that the  right  to\ntravel\tfor  gathering\tinformation is\tin  itself  a  First\nAmendment  right.  Justice Douglas also did not\t regard\t the\nright  to travel abroad as a First Amendment right but\theld\nthat  it is peripheral to the enjoyment of  First  Amendment\nguarantees  because  it gives meaning and substance  to\t the\nFirst  Amendment rights and without it, these  rights  would\nsuffer.\t  That\tis  why he observed  towards  the  end\tthat\nrestrictions   on   the\t right\tto  travel  should   be\t  so\nparticularised that a First Amendment right is not precluded\nor in other words there is no direct infringement of a First\nAmendment  right.   If there is, the restrictions  would  be\nconstitutionally  invalid, but not otherwise.  It  is  clear\nthat Justice Douglas never\n701\nmeant to lay down that a right which is at the periphery  of\nthe  First  right under the First  Amendment.\tThe  learned\nJudge, did not hold the right to travel abroad to be a First\nAmendment  right.   Both according to the majority  as\talso\nJustice Douglas, the question to be asked in each case is  :\nis  the\t restriction  on the right to travel  such  that  it\ndirectly interferes with a First Amendment right.  And\tthat\nis  the\t same  test  which  is\tapplied\t by  this  Court  in\ndetermining infringement of a fundamental right.\nWe cannot, therefore, accept the theory that a peripheral or\nconcomitant right which facilitates the exercise of a  named\nfundamental right or gives it meaning and substance or makes\nits  exercise  effective,  is  itself  a  guaranteed   right\nincluded  within the named fundamental right.  This much  is\nclear  as  a matter of plain construction,  but\t apart\tfrom\nthat, there is a decision of this Court which clearly and in\nso  many  terms\t supports  this\t conclusion.   That  is\t the\ndecision  in\nAll  India  Bank\tEmployees'  Association\t  v.\nNational Industrial Tribunal\n(1).  The legislation which\t was\nchallenged\nin\tthat  case\nwas\nsection 34A\nof\tthe  Banking\nCompanies  Act and it was assailed as violative\t of\nArticle\n19(1)(c).\nThe effect of section 34A was that\tno  tribunal\ncould  compel the production and inspection of any books  of\naccount\t or other documents or require a bank to furnish  or\ndisclose any statement or information if the Banking Company\nclaimed such document or statement or information to be of a\nconfidential nature relating to secret reserves or to provi-\nsion  for bad and doubtful debts.  If a dispute was  pending\nand  a\tquestion  was raised whether  any  amount  from\t the\nreserves or other provisions should be taken into account by\na  tribunal,  the  tribunal could refer the  matter  to\t the\nReserve,  Bank of India whose certificate as to\t the  amount\nwhich  could  be  taken into account,  was  made  final\t and\nconclusive.   Now, it was conceded that section 34A did\t not\nprevent\t the  workmen  from  forming  unions  or  place\t any\nimpediments in their doing so, but it was contended that the\nright to form association protected under\nArticle 19 (1) (c)\ncarried\t with  it  a guarantee that  the  association  shall\neffectively  achieve  the purpose for which  it\t was  formed\nwithout\t interference by law except on grounds\trelevant  to\nthe  preservation  of public order or morality\tset  out  in\nArticle\t 19(4).\nIn other words, the argument was  that\t the\nfreedom to form unions carried with it the concomitant right\nthat  such  unions should be able to fulfil the\t object\t for\nwhich  they. were formed.  This argument was negatived by  a\nunanimous  Bench of this Court.\t The Court said that  unions\nwere  not restricted to workmen, that employers' unions\t may\nbe  formed in order to earn profit and that a guarantee\t for\nthe  effective functioning of the unions would lead  to\t the\nconclusion  that restrictions on their right to earn  profit\ncould  be  put\tonly in the interests  of  public  order  or\nmorality.   Such a construction would run basically  counter\nto the scheme of\nArticle 19\nand to the provisions of\nArticle\n19(1) (c)\nand\n(6).\nThe restrictions which could be  imposed\non  the\t right\tto  form  an  association  were\t limited  to\nrestrictions  in the interest of public order and  morality.\nThe  restrictions  which could be imposed on  the  right  to\ncarry  on  any trade, business, profession or  calling\twere\nreasonable res-\n(1)  [1962] 3 S.C.R. 269.\n702\ntrictions  in the public interest and if the  guarantee\t for\nthe  effective functioning of an association was a  part  of\nthe  right,  then restrictions could not be imposed  in\t the\npublic\tinterest on the business of an association.   Again,\nan association of workmen may claim the right of  collective\nbargaining and the right to strike, yet the right to  strike\ncould not by implication be treated as part of the right  to\nform  association, for, if it were so treated, it would\t not\nbe possible to put restrictions on that right in the  public\ninterest  as is done by the\nIndustrial Disputes\t Act\n,  which\nrestrictions  would be permissible under\nArticle 19(6)\n,\t but\nnot  under\nArticle 19(4).\nThe Court, therefore,  held\tthat\nthe  right to form unions guaranteed by\nArticle 19  (1)\t (c)\ndoes  not carry with it a concomitant right that the  unions\nso  formed should be able to achieve the purpose  for  which\nthey  are brought into existence, so that  any\tinterference\nwith  such  achievement\t by law\t would\tbe  unconstitutional\nunless the same could be justified under\nArticle 19(4).\nThe  right  to go abroad cannot, therefore, be\tregarded  as\nincluded  in  freedom of speech\t and  expression  guaranteed\nunder\nArticle\t19(1)(a)\non the  theory  of  peripheral  or\nconcomitant right.  This theory has been firmly rejected  in\nthe\nAll  India\t Bank Employees Association\n's  case  and  we\ncannot\tcountenance any attempt to revive it, as that  would\ncompletely  upset the scheme of\nArticle 19(1)\nand  to  quote\nthe words of Rajagopala Ayyanger, J., speaking on behalf  of\nthe Court in\nAll India Bank Employees Association\n's case \"by\na series of ever expending concentric. circles in the  shape\nof rights concomitant to concomitant rights and so on,\tlead\nto  an\talmost grostesque result\".  So also,  for  the\tsame\nreasons, the right to go abroad cannot be treated as part of\nthe,  right  to\t carry on  trade,  business,  profession  or\ncalling guaranteed under\nArticle 19(1) (g).\nThe right to go\nabroad is clearly not a guaranteed right under any clause of\nArticle\t 19(1  )\nand\nsection  10(3)  (c)\nwhich  authorises\nimposition  of\trestrictions on the right to  go  abroad  by\nimpounding  of\tpassport  cannot  be  held  to\tbe  void  as\noffending\nArticle  19(1)  (a)\nor (g),\tas  its\t direct\t and\ninevitable  impact is on the right. to go abroad and not  on\nthe  right  of free speech and expression or the.  right  to\ncarry on trade, business profession or calling.\nConstitutional\trequirement of an order under\nSection  10(3)\n(c).\nBut  that does not mean that an order made under\nsection  10\n(3)  (c)\nmay not violate\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nor\t(g).   While\ndiscussing the constitutional validity of the impugned order\nimpounding  the\t passport of the petitioner, we\t shall\thave\noccasion to point out that even where a statutory  provision\nempowering  an authority to take action is  constitutionally\nvalid, action taken under it may offend a fundamental  right\nand in that event, though the statutory provision is  valid,\nthe  action  may be void.  Therefore,  even  though\nsection\n10(3) (c)\nis valid, the question would always remain whether\nan  order  made\t under\tit  is\tinvalid\t as  contravening  a\nfundamental right.  The direct and inevitable. effect of  an\norder  impounding  a passport may, in a given  case,  be  to\nabridge or take away freedom of speech and expression or the\nright  to carry on a profession and where such is the  case,\nthe order would be invalid, unless saved by\nArticle 19(2)\nor\nArticle 19(6).\nTake for\n703\nexample,   a  pilot  with  international   flying   licence.\nInternational  flying is his profession and if his  passport\nis impounded, it would directly interfere with his right  to\ncarry  on  his\tprofession  and\t unless\t the  order  can  be\njustified  on  the ground of public interest  under\nArticle\n19(6)\nit  would be void as offending\nArticle  19  (1)\t(g).\nAnother\t example may be taken of an evangelist who has\tmade\nit  a mission of his life to preach his faith to people\t all\nover the world and for that purpose, set up institutions  in\ndifferent  countries.\tIf an order is made  impounding\t his\npassport, it would directly affect his freedom of speech and\nexpression   and the challenge to the validity of the  order\nunder,\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\nwould be unanswerable unless it is\nsaved  by\narticle 19(2).\nWe have taken these  two  examples\nonly  by way of illustration.  There may be many such  cases\nwhere  the  restriction imposed is apparently  only  on\t the\nright to go abroad but the direct and inevitable consequence\nis to interfere with the freedom of speech and expression or\nthe right to carry on a profession.  A musician may want  to\ngo  abroad to sing, a dancer to dance, a visiting  professor\nto  teach  and a scholar to participate in a  conference  or\nseminar.   If  in  such a case his  passport  is  denied  or\nimpounded,  it would directly interfere with his freedom  of\nspeech and expression.\tIf a correspondent of a newspaper is\ngiven a foreign assignment and he is refused passport or his\npassport is impounded, it would be direct interference\twith\nhis  freedom  to carry on his profession.  Examples  can  be\nmultiplied,  but the point of the matter is that though\t the\nright to go abroad is not a fundamental right, the denial of\nthe right to go abroad may, in truth and in effect, restrict\nfreedom\t of speech and expression or freedom to carry  on  a\nprofession so as to contravene\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\nor 19\t (1)\n(g).   In  such a case, refusal or  impounding\tof  passport\nwould be invalid unless it is justified under\nArticle  19(2)\nor\nArticle 19(6)\n, as the case may be.  Now, passport can  be\nimpounded  under\nsection 10(3)(c)\nif the Passport  Authority\ndeems  it  necessary  so  to do\t in  the  interests  of\t the\nsovereignty  and integrity of India, the security of  India,\nfriendly  relations of India with any foreign country or  in\nthe  interests\tof  the general\t public.   The\tfirst  three\ncategories are the same as those in\nArticle 19 (2)\nand\teach\nof  them, though separately mentioned, is a  species  within\nthe  broad genus of \"interests of the general public\".\t The\nexpression  \"interests\tof the, general public\"\t is  a\twide\nexpression which covers within its broad sweep all kinds  of\ninterests  of the general public including interests of\t the\nsovereignty  and integrity of India, security of  India\t and\nfriendly relations of India with foreign States.  Therefore,\nwhen  an order is made under\nsection 10(3) (c)\n, which is  in\nconformity with the terms of that provision, it would be  in\nthe interests of the general public and even if it restricts\nfreedom\t to carry on a profession, it would be protected  by\nArticle 19(6).\nBut if an order made under\nsection 10(3) (c)\nrestricts freedom of speech and expression, it would not  be\nenough\tthat  it  is made in the interests  of\tthe  general\npublic.\t  It must fall within the terms of\nArticle 19(2)\nin\norder to earn the protection of that Article.  If it is made\nin the interests of the, sovereignty and integrity of  India\nor,  in\t the interests of the security of India\t or  in\t the\ninterests of friendly relations of.  India with any  foreign\ncountry, it would satisfy the requirement of\nArticle  19(2).\nBut  if it is made for any other interests of  the,  general\npublic\tsave  the  interests of \"public\t order,\t decency  or\nmorality\",\n704\nit  would not enjoy the protection of\nArticle 19(2).\nThere\ncan be no doubt that the interests of public order,  decency\nor  morality are \"interests of the general public\" and\tthey\nwould  be covered by\nsection 10(3) (c)\n, but  the  expression\n\"interests  of\tthe general public\" is, as  already  pointed\nout,  a much wider expression and, therefore, in order\tthat\nan order made under\nsection 10(3) (c)\nrestricting freedom of\nspeech\tand expression, may not fall foul of\nArticle  19(1)\n(a),  it is necessary that in relation to such\torder,,\t the\nexpression  \"interests\tof the general\tpublic\"\t in\nsection\n10(3) (c)\nmust be read down so as to be limited to interests\nof  public  order, decency or morality.\t If  an\t order\tmade\nunder\nsection\t10(3) (c)\nrestricts freedom  of\t speech\t and\nexpression,  it\t must be made not in the  interests  of\t the\ngeneral\t public\t in a wider sense, but in the  interests  of\npublic\torder,\tdecency or morality, apart  from  the  other\nthree  categories, namely, interests of the sovereignty\t and\nintegrity  of  India,  the security of\tIndia  and  friendly\nrelations  of India with any foreign country.  If the  order\ncannot be shown to have been made in the interests of public\norder,\tdecency\t or morality, it would not  only  contravene\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\n, but would also be outside the  authority\nconferred by\nsection 10(3) (c)\n.\nConstitutional validity of the impugned Order:\nWe  may\t now  consider, in the\tlight  of  this\t discussion,\nwhether\t the impugned Order made by the\t Central  Government\nimpounding  the\t passport of the  petitioner  under\nsection\n10(3)\t(c)\nsuffers  from  any\t constitutional\t  or   legal\ninfirmity.  The first ground of attack against the  validity\nof the impugned Order was that it was made in  contravention\nof  the rule of natural justice embodied in the\t maxim\taudi\nalteram\t partem and was, therefore, null and void.  We\thave\nalready\t  examined   this  ground   while   discussing\t the\nconstitutional validity of\nsection 10(3) (c)\nwith  reference\nto  Article  21.  and shown how the statement  made  by\t the\nlearned\t Attorney  General on behalf of\t the  Government  of\nIndia  has  cured  the impugned Order of the  vice  of\tnon-\ncompliance  with  the audi alteram partem rule.\t It  is\t not\nnecessary to say anything more about it.  Another ground  of\nchallenge  urged on behalf of the, petitioner was  that\t the\nimpugned  Order\t has the effect of placing  an\tunreasonable\nrestriction  on\t the  right of free  speech  and  expression\nguaranteed  to\tthe petitioner under\nArticle 19 (1)  (a)\nas\nalso on the right to carry on the profession of a journalist\nconferred  under\nArticle; 19(1) (g)\n, in as much as if  seeks\nto  impound  the  passport of  the  petitioner\tidefinitely,\nwithout\t any  limit of time, on the mere likelihood  of\t her\nbeing required in connection with the Commission of  Inquiry\nheaded\tby Mr. Justice J. C. Shah.  It was not competent  to\nthe Central Government, it was argued, to express an opinion\nas  to\twhether the petitioner is likely to be\trequired  in\nconnection  with  the proceeding before\t the  Commission  of\nInquiry.  That would be a matter within the judgment of\t the\nCommission  of\tInquiry\t and it would be  entirely  for\t the\nCommission of Inquiry to decide whether or, not her presence\nis  necessary  in the proceeding before\t it.   The  impugned\nOrder impounding the passport of the petitioner on the basis\nof  a  mere  opinion  by the  central  Government  that\t the\npetitioner  is likely to be required in connection with\t the\nproceeding  before  the Commission of Inquiry  was,  in\t the\ncircumstances,\tclearly unreasonable and hence violative  of\nArticle\n705\n19(1) (a)\nand (g).  This ground of challenge was  vehemently\npressed\t on  behalf of the petitioner  and  supplemented  on\nbehalf of Adil Sahariar who intervened at the hearing of the\nwrit petition, but we do not think there is any substance in\nit.  It is true, and we must straiglitaway concede it,\tthat\nmerely because a statutory provision empowering an authority\ntake  action in specified circumstances is  constitutionally\nvalid as not being in conflict with any fundamental  rights,\nit  does not give a carte blanche to the authority  to\tmake\nany  order it likes so long as it is within  the  parameters\nlaid  down  by\nthe statutory provision.\t  Every\t order\tmade\nunder  a  statutory provision must not only  be\t within\t the\nauthority  conferred  by the statutory provision,  but\tmust\nalso  stand  the  test of  fundamental\trights.\t  Parliament\ncannot be presumed to  have intended to confer power on\t an\nauthority to act in contravention of fundamental rights.  It\nis  a  basic  constitutional  assumption  underlying   every\nstatutory  grant  of power that the authority on  which\t the\npower  is conferred should act constitutionally and  not  in\nviolation of any fundamental rights.\nThis would seem to  be\nelementary  and no authority is necessary in support of\t it,\nbut  if any were needed, it may be found in the decision  of\nthis Court in\nNarendra Kumar & Ors. v. The Union of India  &\nOrs.\n(1).  The question which arose\nin that case\nwas  whether\nclauses (3) and (4) of the Non-ferrous Metal Control  Order,\n1958 made under\nsection 3\nof the Essential Commodities\tAct,\n1955  were  constitutionally valid.  The argument  urged  on\nbehalf\tof  the petitioners was that these  clauses  imposed\nunreasonable   restrictions   of  the\tfundamental   rights\nguaranteed under\nArticles 19(1) (f)\nand (g) and in answer to\nthis argument, apart from merits, a contention of a prelimi-\nnary  nature was advanced on behalf of the  Government\tthat\n\"as the petitioners have not challenged the validity of\t the\nEssential Commodities Act\nand have admitted the power of the\nCentral\t Government  to\t make an order in  exercise  of\t the\npowers conferred by\nsection 3\nof the Act, it is not open  to\nthe Court to consider whether the law made by the Government\nin  making the non-ferrous metal control order-violates\t any\nof  the fundamental rights under the Constitution\".  It\t was\nurged  that  so\t long as the Order does not  go\t beyond\t the\nprovisions  in\nsection 3\nof the Act, it \"must be held to  be\ngood  and the consideration of any question of\tinfringement\nof  fundamental\t rights\t under the  Constitution  is  wholly\nbeside\tthe point\".  This argument was characterised by\t Das\nGupta,\t J.,  speaking\ton  behalf  of\tthe  Court  as\t \"an\nextravagant  argument\"\tand  it\t was  said  that  \"such\t  an\nextravagant  argument has merely to be mentioned to  deserve\nrejection\".   The  learned  Judge  proceeded  to  state\t the\nreasons for rejecting this argument in the following words :\n\"If there was any reason to think that\nsection\n3\nof the Act confers on the Central Government\npower to do anything which is in conflict with\nthe  constitution-anything which violates\t any\nof  the  fundamental rights conferred  by\t the\nConstitution,   that  fact  alone\t  would\t  be\nsufficient and unassailable ground for holding\nthat  the section itself is void\tbeing  ultra\nvires  the  Constitution.\t When,\tas  in\tthis\ncase, no challenge is made that section .3  of\nthe Act is ultra vires the Constitu-\n(1)   [1960] 2 S.C.R. 375.\n706\ntion, it is on the assumption that the  powers\ngranted\tthereby\t  do   not   violate,\t the\nConstitution  and do not empower\tthe  Central\nGovernment   to\tdo   anything\twhich\t the\nConstitution prohibits.  It is fair and proper\nto  presume  that\t in passing  'this  Act\t the\nParliament  could not possibly  have  intended\nthe  words  used by it, viz.,  \"may  by  order\nprovide  for  regulating\tor  prohibiting\t the\nproduction,  supply and distribution  thereof,\nand trade and commerce in\", to include a power\nto  make such provisions even though they\t may\nbe in contravention of the Constitution.\t The\nfact  that the Words \"in accordance  with\t the\nprovisions    of\t the   articles\t   of\t the\nConstitution\"  are not used in the section  is\nof no consequence.  Such words have to be read\nby  necessary implication in  every  provision\nand  every law made by the Parliament  on\t any\nday  after the Constitution came\tinto  force.\nIt  is  clear therefore that  when\nsection  3\nconfers  power  to provide for  regulation  or\nprohibition  of  the  production,\t supply\t and\ndistribution  of\tany essential  commodity  it\ngives  such  power to make any  regulation  or\nprohibition  in so far as such regulation\t and\nprohibition  do  not violate  any\t fundamental\nrights granted by the Constitution of India.\"\nIt would thus be clear that though the impugned Order may be\nwithin the terms of\nsection 10(3) (c)\n, it must\tnevertheless\nnot  contravene\t any fundamental rights and if it  does,  it\nwould be void.\tNow, even if an order impounding a  passport\nis  made  in  the  interests of\t public\t order,\t decency  or\nmorality,  the\trestriction imposed by it may  be  so  wide,\nexcessive or disproportionate to the mischief or evil sought\nto be averted that it may be considered unreasonable and  in\nthat  event, if the direct and inevitable  consequence,,  of\nthe  Order is to abridge or take away freedom of speech\t and\nexpression,  it would be violative of\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nand\nwould  not be protected by\nArticle 19(2)\nand the same  would\nbe the position where the, order is in the interests of the'\ngeneral\t public but it impinges directly and  inevitably  on\nthe freedom to carry on a profession in which case it  would\ncontravene\nArticle  19 (1) (g)\nwithout being saved  by\t the\nprovision enacted in\nArticle 19(6).\nBut  we do not think that the impugned Order in the  present\ncase violates either\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nor\nArticle 19(1) (g).\nWhat  the impugned Order does is to impound the passport  of\nthe petitioner and thereby prevent her from going abroad and\nat  the\t date  when the impugned order\twas  made  there  is\nnothing\t to  show that the petitioner was  intending  to  go\nabroad for the purpose of exercising her freedom of  speech\nand expression or her right to carry on her profession as  a\njournalist.   The direct and inevitable consequence  of\t the\nimpugned order was to impede the exercise of her right to go\nabroad\tand not to interfere with her freedom of speech\t and\nexpression or her right to carry on her profession.  But we,\nmust  hasten to point out that if at any time in the  future\nthe  petitioner\t wants\tto  go abroad  for  the\t purpose  of\nexercising  her\t freedom  of speech and\t expression  or\t for\ncarrying  on her profession as a journalist and she  applies\nto  the\t Central  Government to release\t the  passport,\t the\nquestion  would\t definitely  arise whether  the\t refusal  to\nrelease or in other words, continuance of the impounding of\n707\nthe passport is in the interests of public order, decency or\nmorality  in  the first case, and in the  interests  of\t the\ngeneral\t public\t in  the second, and  the  restriction\tthus\nimposed\t is reasonable so, as to come within the  protection\nof\nArticle 19(2)\nor\nArticle 19(6).\nThat is,  however,\t not\nthe question before us at present.\nWe  may\t observe that if the impugned Order  impounding\t the\npassport  of the petitioner were violative, of her right  to\nfreedom\t of speech and expression or her right to  carry  on\nher  profession\t as a journalist, it would not be  saved  by\nArticle\t 19(2)\nor\nArticle 19(6)\n, because the  impounding  of\nthe passport for an indefinite length of time would  clearly\nconstitute an unreasonable restriction.\t The Union contended\nthat  though the period for which the impugned Order was  to\noperate\t was  not specified in so many terms, it  was  clear\nthat it was intended to be co-terminous with the duration of\nthe  Commission of Inquiry, since the reason for  impounding\nwas  that  the presence of the petitioner was likely  to  be\nrequired in connection with the proceedings before the\tCom-\nmission of Inquiry and the term of the Commission of Inquiry\nbeing limited upto 31st December, 1977, the impoundig of the\npassport  could not continue beyond that date and  hence  it\nwould not be said that the impugned Order was to operate for\nan  indefinite\tperiod of time.\t Now, it is  true  that\t the\npassport of the petitioner was impounded on the ground\tthat\nher  presence was likely to be required in  connection\twith\nthe  proceeding\t before the Commission of  Inquiry  and\t the\ninitial\t time limit fixed for the Commission of\t Inquiry  to\nsubmit\tits  report was 31st December, 1977,  but  the\ttime\nlimit  could  always be extended by the Government  and\t the\nexperience of several Commissions of Inquiry set up in\tthis\ncountry\t over the last twenty-five years shows\tthat  hardly\nany  Commission\t of Inquiry has been able  to  complete\t its\nreport within the originally appointed time.  Whatever might\nhave  been the expectation in regard to the duration of\t the\nCommission  of\tInquiry headed by Mr. Justice Shall  at\t the\ntime when the impugned Order was made, it is now clear\tthat\nit  has not been possible for it to complete its labours  by\n31st  December,\t 1977 which was the  time  limit  originally\nfixed and in fact its term has been extended upto 31st\tMay,\n1978.\tThe  period  for which\tthe  passport  is  impounded\ncannot,\t in  the circumstances, be said to be  definite\t and\ncertain\t and it may extend to an indefinite point  of  time.\nThis would clearly make the impugned order unreasonable\t and\nthe  learned  Attorney General appearing on  behalf  of\t the\nCentral Government, therefore, made a statement that in case\nthe  decision to impound the passport of the  petitioner  is\nconfirmed  by  the  Central  Government\t after\thearing\t the\npetitioner, \"the duration of the impounding will not  exceed\na  period of six months from the date of the  decision\tthat\nmay  be taken on the petitioner's representation\".  It\tmust\nbe said in fairness to the Central Government that this\t was\na  very reasonable stand to adopt, because in  a  democratic\nsociety\t governed by the rule of law, it is expected of\t the\nGovernment  that it should act not only\t constitutional\t and\nlegally but also fairly and justly towards the citizen.\t  We\nhope and trust that in future also whenever the passport  of\nany  person  is\t impounded  under\nsection  10(3)  (c)\n,\t the\nimpounding would be for a specified period of time which  is\nnot  unreasonably long, even though no contravention of\t any\nfundamental right may be involved.\n708\nThe  last  argument  that  the\timpugned  Order\t could\tnot,\nconsistently  with\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nand (g), be based on  a\nmere opinion of the Central Government that the presence  of\nthe  petitioner is likely to be required in connection\twith\nthe  proceeding\t bEfore the Commission of  lnquiry  is\talso\nwithout\t force.\t  It is true that ultimately it is  for\t the\nCommission of Inquiry to decide whether the presence of\t the\npetitioner  is\trequired in order to assist it in  its\tfact\nfinding\t mission,  but\tthe  Central  Government  which\t has\nconstituted  the  Commission of Inquiry and  laid  down\t its\nterms  of  reference would certainly be able,  to  say\twith\nreasonable anticipation whether she is likely to be required\nby  the\t Commission of Inquiry.\t Whether  she,\tis  actually\nrequired  would be for the Commission of Inquiry to  decide,\nbut  whether she is likely to be required can  certainly  be\njudged\tby  the\t Central  Government.\tWhen  the,   Central\nGovernment appoints a Commission of Inquiry, it does not act\nin a vacuum.  It is bound to have some material before it on\nthe  basis of which it comes of a decision that there  is  a\ndefinite  matter  of  public importance which  needs  to  be\ninquired into and appoints a Commission of Inquiry for\tthat\npurpose.   The Central Government would, therefore, be in  a\nposition  to  say  whether the petitioner is  likely  to  be\n,required  in  connection  with the  proceeding\t before\t the\nCommission of Inquiry.\tIt is possible that ultimately\twhen\nthe  Commission of Inquiry proceeds further with the  probe,\nit  may\t find that the presence of the\t,petitioner  is\t not\nrequired,  but before that it would only be in the stage  of\nlikelihood and that can legitimately be left to the judgment\nof  the\t central Government.  The validity of  the  impugned\nOrder  cannot, ,therefor.-, be assailed on this ground,\t had\nthe challenge based on\nArticle 19 (1) (a)\nand (g) must fail.\nWhether the impugned Order is inter vires\nsec. 10(3) (c)\n?\nThe last question which remains to be considered is  whether\nthe  impugned  Order is within the  authority  conferred  by\nsection\t 10(3) (c)\n.  The impugned Order is plainly,  on\t the\nface  of it, purported to be made in public interest,  i.e.,\nin  the interests of the general public, and therefore,\t its\nvalidity must be judged on that footing.  Now it is  obvious\nthat on a plain natural construction of\nsection 10(3)(c)\n, it\nis left to the Passport Authority to determine whether it is\nnecessary  to  impound a passport in the  interests  of\t the\ngeneral public.\t But an order made by the Passport Authority\nimpounding  a passport is subject to judicial review on\t the\nground that the order is mala fide, or that the reasons\t for\nmaking the order are extraneous or they have no relevance to\nthe interests of the general public or they cannot  possibly\nsupport\t the  making of the order in the  interests  of\t the\ngeneral public.\t It was not disputed on behalf of the Union,\nand  indeed  it\t could not be in view of\nsection  10\n,\tsub-\nsection\t (5)  that, save in certain  exceptional  cases,  of\nwhich this was admittedly not one, the Passport Authority is\nbound  to  give\t reasons for making an\torder  impounding  a\npassport  and  though  in  the\tpresent\t case,\tthe  Central\nGovernment initially declined to give reasons claiming\tthat\nit was not in the interests of the general public to do\t so,\nit realised the utter untenability of this position when  it\ncame  to  file\tthe affidavit in  reply\t and  disclosed\t the\nreasons\t which were recorded at the time when  the  impugned\norder  'Was passed.  These reasons were that,  according  to\nthe Central Government, the petitioner was involved\n709\nin  matters coming within the purview of the Commissions  of\nInquiry\t constituted by the Government of India\t to  inquire\ninto excesses committed during the emergency and in  respect\nof matters concerning Maruti and its associate companies and\nthe  Central Government was of the view that the  petitioner\nshould\tbe available in India to give evidence before  these\nCommissions of Inquiry and she should have an opportunity to\npresent\t her  views before them and according to,  a  report\nreceived  by the Central Government on that day,  there\t was\nlikelihood  of\ther  leaving India.  The  argument  of\tthe,\npetitioner was that these reasons did not justify the making\nof  the,  impugned  Order in the interests  of\tthe  general\npublic, since these reasons had no reasonable nexus with the\ninterests  of the general public within the meaning of\tthat\nexpression  as\tused in\nsection 10(3) (c)\n.\nThe  petitioner\ncontended  that\t the expression \"interests  of\tthe  general\npublic\" must be construed in the context of the\t perspective\nof the statute and since the power to issue a passport is  a\npower  related\tto foreign affairs, the\t \"interests  of\t the\ngeneral\t public,\" must be understood as referable only to  a\nmatter\thaving some nexus with foreign affairs and it  would\nnot  be\t given\ta wider meaning.  So  read,  the  expression\n\"interests  of\tthe  general  public\"  could  not  cover   a\nsituation  where the presence of a person required  to\tgive\nevidence  before a Commission of Inquiry.  This argument  is\nplainly\t erroneous  as it seeks to cut down  the  width\t and\namplitude  of  the  expression \" interests  of\tthe  general\npublic\",  an  expression which has a well  recognised  legal\nconnotation  and  which is to be found in\nArticle  19(5)\nas\nwell  as\narticle 19(6).\nIt is true, as pointed out by\tthis\nCourt in\nRohtas Industries Ltd. v. S. D. Agarwal &  Anr.\n(1),\nthat  \"there is always a perspective within which a  statute\nis  intended to operate\", but that does not justify  reading\nof  a statutory provision in a manner not warranted  by\t its\nlanguage  or  narrowing\t down  its  scope  and\tmeaning\t  by\nintroducing  a limitation which has no basis either  in\t the\nlanguage  or  in  the context of  the  statutory  provision.\nMoreover,  it  is evident from clauses (d), (e) and  (h)  of\nsection\t 10(3)\nthat  there are.  several  grounds  in\tthis\nsection\t which do not relate to foreign affairs.  Hence we\ndo not think the petitioner is justified in seeking to limit\nthe expression \"interests of the general public\" to  matters\nrelating to foreign affairs.\nThe petitioner then contended that the requirement that she\nshould\t be  available\tfor  giving  evidence\tbefore\t the\nCommissions  of\t Inquiry did not warrant the making  of\t the\nimpugned  Order\t \"in the interests of the  general  public\".\nSection 10(3)\n,according to the petitioner, contained clauses\n(e)  and (h) dealing specifically with cases where a  person\nis  required in connection with a legal proceeding  and\t the\nenactment of these two specific provisions clearly indicated\nthe  legislative  intent that the general power\t in\nsection\n10(3) (c)\nunder the ground \"interests of the general public\"\nwas  not meant to be exercised for impounding a passport  in\ncases where a person is required in connection with a  legal\nproceeding.   The  Central Government  was,  therefore,\t not\nentitled to resort to this general power under\nsection 10(3)\n(c)  for  the  purpose of impounding  the  passport  of\t the\npetitioner on the ground that she was\n(1)  1969] 3 S.C.R. 108 at 128.\n7-119 SCI /78\n710\nrequired to give evidence before the Commissions of Inquiry.\nThe, power to impound the passport of the petitioner in such\na case was either to be found in\nsection 10(3) (h)\nor it did\nnot  exist at all.  This argument is also unsustainable\t and\nmust  be rejected.  It seeks to rely on the maxim  expressio\nunius  exclusio\t ulterius  and proceeds on  the\t basis\tthat\nclauses (e) and (h) of\nsection 10(3)\nare exhaustive of cases\nwhere a person is required in connection with a\t proceeding,\nwhether\t before a court or a Commission of Inquiry,  and  no\nresort\tcan be had to the general power under\nsection  10(3)\n(c) in cases where a person is required in connection with a\nproceeding  before a Commission of Inquiry.  But it must  be\nnoted  that  this is not a case where  the  maxim  expressio\nunius exclusio ulterius has any application at all.\nSection\n10(3)  (e)\ndeals with a case where proceedings\tare  pending\nbefore a criminal court while\nsection 10(3) (b)\ncontemplates\na situation where a warrant or summons for the appearance or\na  warrant for the arrest, of the holder of a  passport\t has\nbeen issued by a court or an order prohibiting the departure\nfrom  India of the holder of the passport has been  made  by\nany such court.\t Neither of these two provisions deals\twith\na case where a proceeding is pending before a Commission  of\nInquiry\t and the Commission has not yet issued a summons  or\nwarrant\t for the attendance of the holder of  the  passport.\nWe may assume for the purpose of argument that a Commission-\nof  Inquiry  is a 'court' for the purpose of\nsection  10(3)\n(h),  but even so, a case of this kind would not be  covered\nby\nsection 10(3) (h)\nand\nsection 10(3) (e)\nwould in any case\nnot have application.  Such a case would clearly fall within\nthe general power under\nsection 10(3) (c)\nif it can be shown\nthat  the  requirement\tof the holder  of  the\tpassport  in\nconnection  with  the proceeding before\t the  Commission  of\nInquiry\t is in the interests of the general public.  It\t is,\nof  course, open to the Central Government to apply  to\t the\nCommission  of Inquiry for issuing a summons or warrant,  as\nthe  case  may be, for the attendance of the holder  of\t the\npassport  before the Commission and if a summons or  warrant\nis so issued, it is possible that the Central Government may\nbe entitled to impound the passport under\nsection 10(3) (h)\n.\nBut  that does not mean that before the stage of  issuing  a\nsummons or warrant has arrived, the Central Government\tcan-\nnot impound the passport of a person, if otherwise it can be\nshown  to be in the, interests of the general public  to  do\nso.\nSection 10(3) (e)\nand (h) deal only with two  specific\nkinds  of  situations,\tbut  there may\tbe  a  myriad  other\nsituations, not possible to anticipate or categorise,  where\npublic\tinterests  may require that the passport  should  be\nimpounded  and such situation would be taken care  of  under\nthe  general provision enacted in\nsection 10(3) (c)\n.  It  is\ntrue that this is a rather drastic power to interfere with a\nbasic human right, but it must be remembered that this power\nhas been conferred by the legislature in public interest and\nwe  have  no doubt that it will be sparingly used  and\tthat\ntoo,  with  great  care and circumspection  and\t as  far  as\npossible,  the\tpassport of a person will not  be  impounded\nmerely\ton  the ground of his being required  in  connection\nwith a proceeding, unless the case is brought within\nsection\n10(3)  (e)\nor\nsection 10(3) (b)\n.  We may echo the  sentiment\nin Lord Denning's closing remarks in Ghani v. Jones(1)\n(1)  [1970] Q.B.693.\n711\n'where\tthe  learned  Master of the Rolls said\t:  \"A  man's\nliberty\t of  movement is regarded so highly by\tthe  law  of\nEngland that it is not to be hindered or prevented except on\nthe severest grounds\".\tThis liberty is prized equally\thigh\nin  our country and we are sure that a Government  committed\nto basic human values will respect it.\nWe  must  also\tdeal  with  one\t other\tcontention  of\t the\npetitioner,  though  we must confess that it  was  a  little\ndifficult for us to appreciate it. The petitioner urged that\nin  order  that a passport may be impounded  under\nsection\n10(3) (c)\n, public interest must actually exist ill  presenti\nand  mere likelihood of public interest arising\t in  future,\nwould  be no ground for impoundig a passport.  We  entirely\nagree  with  the  petitioner  that  an\torder  impounding  a\npassport can be made by the Passport Authority only if it is\nactually in the interests of the general public to do so and\nit  is not enough that the interests of the  general  public\nmay  be likely to be served in future by the making  of\t the\norder.\t But here in the present case, it was not merely  on\nthe future likelihood of the interests of the general public\nadvanced  that\tthe impugned order was made by\tthe  Central\nGovernment.   The  impugned Order was made because,  in\t the\nopinion\t of  the  Central Government, the  presence  of\t the\npetitioner was necessary for giving evidence before the Com-\nmissions of Inquiry and according to the report received  by\nthe  Central Government, she was likely to leave  India\t and\nthat might frustrate or impede to some extent the  inquiries\nwhich were being conducted by the Commissions of Inquiry.\nThen  it was contended on behalf of the petitioner that\t the\nMinister  for External Affairs, who made the impugned  Order\non behalf of the Central Government, did not apply his\tmind\nand  hence the impugned Order was bad.\tWe find no basis  or\njustification  for this contention.  It has been  stated  in\nthe  affidavit\tin  reply that\tthe  Minister  for  External\nAffairs\t applied his mind to the relevant material and\talso\nto   the   confidential\t information   received\t  from\t the\nintelligence  sources  that  there  was\t likelihood  of\t the\npetitioner attempting to leave the country and then only  he\nmade  the  impugned Order.  In fact, the  Ministry  of\tHome\nAffairs had forwarded to the Ministry of External Affairs as\nfar back as 9th May, 1977 a list of persons whose  presence,\nin  view of their involvement or connection or\tposition  or\npast  antecedents, was likely to be required  in  connection\nwith  inquiries\t to  be carried out by\tthe  Commissions  of\nInquiry and the name of the petitioner was included in\tthis\nlist.  The Home Ministry had also intimated to the  Ministry\nof External Affairs that since the inquiries were being held\nby   the   Commissions\tof  Inquiry  in\t  public   interest,\nconsideration  of public interest would justify recourse  to\nsection\t 10(3)\t(c)\nfor impounding  the  passports  of\t the\npersons\t mentioned in this list.  This note of the  Ministry\nof Home Affairs was considered by the Minister for  External\nAffairs\t and despite the suggestion made in this  note,\t the\npassports of only eleven persons, out of those mentioned  in\nthe  list,  were ordered to be impounded and no\t action\t was\ntaken  in regard to the passport of the petitioner.   It  is\nonly  on  1st  July, 1977 when\tthe  Minister  for  External\nAffairs\t  received   confidential   information\t  that\t the\npetitioner was likely to attempt to leave the country  that,\nafter applying his mind to the relevant material and  taking\ninto account confidential information,\n712\nhe made the impugned Order.  It, is, therefore, not possible\nto say that the Minister for External Affairs did not  apply\nhis mind and mechanically made the impugned Order.\nThe  petitioner lastly contended that it was not correct  to\nsay that the petitioner was likely to be required for giving\nevidence before the Commissions of Inquiry.  The petitioner,\nit  was said, had nothing to do with any emergency  excesses\nnor  was  she  connected in any manner with  Maruti  or\t its\nassociate  concerns, and, therefore, she could not  possibly\nhave any evidence to give before the Commissions of Inquiry.\nBut this is not a matter which the court can be called\tupon\nto  investigate.  It is not for the court to decide  whether\nthe presence of the petitioner is likely to be required\t for\ngiving\tevidence  before  he  Commissions  of  Inquiry.\t The\nGovernment, which has instituted the Commissions of Inquiry,\nwould  be best in a position to know, having regard  to\t the\nmaterial  before it, whether the presence of the  petitioner\nis  likely to be required.  It may be that her presence\t may\nultimately not be required at all, but at the present stage,\nthe  question is only whether her presence is likely  to  be\nrequired and So Far that is concerned, we do not think\tthat\nthe  view  taken  by the Government can be  regarded  as  so\nunreasonable  or  perverse  that we would  strike  down\t the\nimpugned  Order\t based upon it as an arbitrary\texercise  of\npower.\nWe  do not, therefore, see any reason to interfere with\t the\nimpugned Order made by the Central Government.\tWe, however,\nwish  to utter a word of caution to the\t Passport  Authority\nwhile  exercising  the power of refusing  or  impounding  or\ncancelling a passport.\tThe Passport Authority would do well\nto  remember  that it is a basic human right  recognised  in\nArticle 13\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with\nwhich the Passport Authority, is interfering when it refuses\nor `impounds or cancels a passport.  It is a highly valuable\nright which is a part of personal liberty, an aspect of\t the\nspiritual  dimension  of man, and it should not\t be  lightly\ninterfered  with.  Cases are not unknown where\tpeople\thave\nnot  been  allowed to go abroad because of the\tviews  held,\nopinions   expressed  or  political  beliefs   or   economic\nideologies entertained by them.\t It is hoped that such cases\nwill not recur under a Government constitutionally committed\nto uphold freedom and liberty but it is well to remember, at\nall  times, that eternal vigilance is the price of  liberty,\nfor  history  shows that it is always subtle  and  insidious\nencroachments\tmade  ostensibly  for  a  good\tcause\tthat\nimperceptibly but surety corrode the foundations of liberty.\nIn  view  of  the statement made by  the  learned  Attorney-\nGeneral\t to  which reference has already been  made  in\t the\njudgment we do not think it necessary to formally  interfere\nwith  the impugned order.  We, accordingly, dispose  of\t the\nWrit Petition without passing any formal order.\t There\twill\nbe no order as to costs.\nKRISHNA\t IYER, J.-My concurrence with the argumentation\t and\nconclusion contained in the judgment of 'my learned  brother\nBhagwati  J. is sufficient to regard this supplementary,  in\none  sense,  a mere redundancy.\t But in another\t sense\tnot,\nwhere  the vires of a law, which arms the Central  Executive\nwith wide powers of potentially imperilling some\n713\nof  the life-giving liberties of the people in\ta  pluralist\nsystem like ours, is under challenge; and more so, when\t the\nground\tis virgin, and the subject is of growing  importance\nto more numbers as Indians acquire habits of  trans-national\ntravel and realise the fruits of foreign tours, reviving  in\nmodem terms, what our forbears effectively did to put Bharat\non  the cosmic cultural and commercial map.  India is  India\nbecause\t Indians,  our ancients, had journeyed\tthrough\t the\nwide world for commerce, spiritual and material,  regardless\nof  physical  or mental frontiers.

Such is my justification. for  breaking  judicial\nlock-jaw  to  express sharply the juristic  perspective\t and\nphilosophy  behind  the practical necessities  and  possible\ndangers\t that society and citizenry may face if the  clauses\nof our Constitution are not bestirred into court action when\na  charge  of  unjustified  handcuffs  on  free\t speech\t and\nunreasonable  fetters on right of exit is made\tthrough\t the\nexecutive  power  of Passport impoundment.  Even so,  in  my\nseparate opinion, I propose only to paint the back drop with\na  broad brush, project the high points with bold lines\t and\ntouch  up the portrait drawn so well by brother Bhagwati  J,\nif   I\tmay  colourfully,  yet\trespectfully,  endorse\t his\njudgment.\nRemember,   even  democracies  have  experienced   executive\nlawlessness  and  eclipse  of liberty on the  one  hind\t and\n'subversive' use of freedoms by tycoons and saboteurs on the\nother,\tand  then  the\tsummons to  judges  comes  from\t the\nConstitution,\tover-riding  the  necessary   deference\t  to\ngovernment  and\t seeing in perspective,\t and  overseeing  in\neffective  operation  the enjoyment of the  'great  rights'.\nThis Court lays down the law not pro tempore but lastingly.\nBefore us is a legislation regulating travel abroad.

Let  us\t grasp\t the\npermissible  restraints\t on  personal liberty,\tone  of\t the\nfacets\tof which is the right of exit beyond one's  country.\nThe  sublime sweep of the subject of personal  liberty\tmust\ncome  within  our  ken\tif  we are  to\tdo  justice  to\t the\nconstitutional\tlimitations which may, legitimately, be\t im-\nposed on its exercise.\tSpeaking briefly, the architects  of\nour Founding Document, (and their fore-runners) many of whom\nwere  front-line fighters for national freedom,\t were  lofty\nhumanists who were profoundly spiritual and deeply  secular,\nenriched  by  vintage values and  revolutionary\t urges\tand,\nabove all, experientially conscious of the deadening  impact\nof  the\t colonial  screening of\t Indians  going\t abroad\t and\nhistorically 'sensitive to the struggle for liberation being\nwaged from foreign lands.  And their testament is our asset.\nWhat is the history, enlivened by philosophy, of the law  of\ntravel ?  The roots of our past reach down to travels  laden\nwith our culture and commerce and its spread-out beyond\t the\noceans\tand the mountains, so much so our  history  unravels\nexchange  between India and the wider world.   This  legacy,\nepitomised  as\t'the  glory that was Ind',  was\t partly\t the\nproduct of travels into India and out of India.\t It was\t the\ntwo-way\t traffic  of  which there  is  testimony  inside  in\nNalanda,  and outside, even in Ulan Bator.   Our  literature\nand  arts bear immortal testimony to our thirst\t for  travel\nand even our law, over two thousand years ago, had canalised\ntravels\t abroad.  For instance, in the days of Kautilya\t (BC\n321-296)  there was a Superintendent of Passports 'to  issue\npasses\tat the rate of a masha a pass'.\t Further details  on\npassport law are found in Katutilya's Arthasastra.\n715\nIndeed,\t viewing the subject from the angle of\tgeo-cultural\nend  legal  anthropology  and current  history,\t freedom  of\nmovement and its off-shoot-the institution of  passport-have\nbeen there through the Hellenic, Roman, Israelite,  Chinies,\nPersian and other civilisations.  Socrates, in his  dialogue\nwith  Crito,  spoke of personal liberty.   He  regarded\t the\nright  of  everyone to save his country as an  attribute  of\npersonal liberty.  He made the laws speak thus\n\"We  further proclaim to any Athenian  by\t the\nliberty  which we allow him, that if  he\tdoes\nnot like us when he has become of age and\t has\nseen  the ways of the city, and made  our\t ac-\nquaintance, he may go where he please and take\nhis  goods  with him.  None of our  laws\twill\nforbid him, or interfere with him.  Anyone who\ndoes  not like us and the city, and who  wants\nto  emigrate to a colony or to any other\tcity\nmay   go\t where\the  likes,   retaining\t his\nproperty.\"\n(Plato, Dialogues)\nThe  Magna  Carta, way back in 1215 A.D. on  the  greens  of\nRunnymede,  affirmed the freedom to move beyond the  borders\nof  the\t kingdom  and, by the time of  Blackstone,  'by\t the\ncommon\tlaw, every man may go out of the realm for  whatever\ncause  he  pleaseth, without obtaining\tthe  king's  leave'.\nLord  Diplock  in D.P.P. v. Shagwan(1)\tstated\tthat  'Prior\nto....\t1962........... a British subject had the  right  at\ncommon\tlaw  to\t enter the United  Kingdom  without  let  or\nhindrance  when and where he pleased and to remain there  as\nlong   as  he  liked'  (International  &   Comparative\t Law\nQuarterly, Vol. 23, July 1974, p. 646).\t As late as Ghani v.\nJones(2)  Lord\tDenning\t asserted  :  'A  man's\t liberty  of\nmovement is regarded so highly by the Law of England that it\nis  not\t to be hindered or prevented except on\tthe  'surest\ngrounds' (I & C. L. Qrly, ibid. p. 646).  In 'Freedom  under\nthe  Law\"  Lord\t Denning has  observed\tunder  the  sub-bead\n'Personal Freedom' :\n\"Let  me first define my terms.\tBy  personal\nfreedom  I  mean\tthe freedom  of\t every\tlaw-\nabiding citizen to think what he will, to\t say\nwhat  he will, and to go where he will on\t his\nlawful occasions without let or hindrance from\nany  other  persons.  Despite all\t the  great.\nchanges  that  have come about  in  the  other\nfreedoms,\t this  freedom has  in\tour  country\nremained intact.\"\nIn  'Freedom, The Individual and the Law, Prof.\t Street\t has\nexpressed  a like view.\t Prof.\tH.W.R.

And Justice Douglas, in the last decade, refined\nand  re-stated,\t in classic diction, the  basics  of  travel\njurisprudence in Apthekar(3).\n\"The  freedom of movement is the very  essence\nof  our free society, setting us apart.\tLike\nthe  right  of  assembly\tand  the  right\t  of\nassociation,   it\t often\tmakes\tall   rights\nmeaningful\n(1)   [1972]A.C.60.\n(2)   [1970] 1 Q.

K. Gopalan(2  )  and  a\nstream of judicial thought since then, had felt impelled  to\nunderscore  personal  liberty as embracing right  to  travel\nabroad.\t  Tambe CJ in A. G. Kazi(3) speaking for a  Division\nBench,\tmade a comprehensive survey of the law and  vivified\nthe concept thus:\n\"In  our\topinion, the language  used  in\t the\nArticle  (\nArt.  21\n) also\tindicates  that\t the\nexpression 'Personal liberty' is not  confined\nonly  to freedom from physical restraint,\t ie.\nbut\t includes a full range of conduct which\t a\nn\nindividual  is free to pursue within law,\t for\ninstance,\t eat  and drink what he\t likes,\t mix\nwith people whom he likes, read what he likes,\nsleep  when  and as long as he  likes,  travel\nwherever\the  likes,  go\twherever  he  likes,\nfollow  profession,  vocation or\tbusiness  he\nlikes,  of  course, in the manner and  to\t the\nextent permitted by law.\"\n(P. 240)\nThe  legal vicissitudes of the passport story in the  United\nStates\tbear out the fluctuating fortunes of fine men  being\ndenied\tthis  great right to go\t abroad-Linus  Pauling,\t the\nNobel  Prize-winner,  Charles  Chaplin,\t the  screen   super\ngenius,\t Paul Robesen, the world singer, Arthur Miller,\t the\ngreat  author  and  even Williams  L.

Absent  forensic\nsentinels, it is not unusual for people to be suppressed  by\npower in the name of the people.  The politics of  passports\nhas  often  tried  to bend  the\t jurisprudence\tof  personal\nlocomotion to serve its interests.  The twilight of  liberty\nmust affect the thought ways of judges.\nThings\thave  changed, global awareness, in grey  hues,\t has\ndawned.\t  The  European\t Convention  on\t Human\tRights\t and\nbilateral understandings have made headway to widen  freedom\nof  travel  abroad  as integral to  liberty  of\t the  person\n(Fourth\t Protocol).  And the Universal Declaration of  Human\nRights has proclaimed in\nArt. 13 :\n\"(1)  Everyone  has the right  to\t freedom  of\nmovement\tand residence within the borders  of\neach State.\n(2)   Everyone  has  the right  to  leave\t any\ncountry,\tincluding his own, and to return  to\nhis country.\"\nThis  right  is yet inchoate and only lays the\tbase.\tBut,\nhopefully,  the loftiest towers rise from the  ground.\t And\ndespite\t destructive  was  and\texploitative  trade,  racial\nhatreds\t and  credal  quarrels,\t colonial  subjections\t and\nauthoritarian  spells,\tthe world has  advanced\t because  of\ngregarious  men\t adventuring forth, taking with\t them  their\nthoughts and feelings on a trans-national scale.  This human\nplanet is our single home, though geographically variegated,\nculturally  diverse, politically pluralist, in\tscience\t and\ntechnology  competitive and cooperative, in arts  and  life-\nstyles\ta  lovely  mosaic and, above all,  suffused  with  a\ncosmic\tconsciousness of unity and  inter-dependence.\tThis\nGrand  Canyon  has been the slow product  of  the  perennial\nprocess\t  of  cultural\tinteraction,   intellectual   cross-\nfertilization, ideological and religious confrontations\t and\nmeeting and mating of social systems; and the wellspring  is\nthe wanderlust of man and his wondrous spirit moving towards\na united human order founded on human rights.  Human advance\nhas been promoted through periods of pre-history and history\nby the flow of fellowmen, and the world owes much to  exiles\nand   emigres\tfor   liberation,   revolution,\t  scientific\nexploration  and  excellence in arts.\tStop  this  creative\nmobility  by totalitarian decree and whole  communities\t and\ncultures will stagnate and international awakening so  vital\nfor the survival of homo sapiens wither away.  To argue\t for\narbitrary  inhibition  of  travel  rights  under   executive\ndirective or legislative tag is to invite\n718\nand  accelerate future shock.  This broader setting  is\nnecessary if we, are to view the larger import of the  right\nto  passport  in its fundamental bearings.  It\tis  not\t law\nalone  but life's leaven.  It is not a casual  facility\t but\nthe core of liberty.\nViewed\tfrom  another  angle, travel abroad  is\t a  cultural\nenrichment  which enables one's understanding of  one's\t own\ncountry\t in better light.  Thus it serves national  interest\nto  have its citizenry 'see other countries and judge  one's\ncountry\t on a comparative scale.  Rudyard.  Kipling,  though\nwith an imperial ring, has aptly said\n\"Winds of the World, give answer\nThey are whimpering to and fro\nAnd what should they know of England\nWho only England know ?\"\n(The English Flag)\nWhy  is the right to travel all over the world and into\t the\nbeyond a human right and a constitutional freedom ? Were  it\nnot so, the human heritage would have been more hapless, the\nhuman family more divided, the human order more unstable and\nthe human future more murky.\nThe Indian panorama from the migrant yore to tourist flow is\nan  expression\tof  the will to\t explore  the  Infinite,  to\npromote\t understanding\tof  the universe,  to  export  human\nexpertise  and development of every resource.\tThus  humble\npride  of patriotic heritage would have been pre-empted\t had\nthe  ancient  kings  and mediaval  rulers  banished  foreign\ntravel\tas our imperial masters nearly did.  And to look  at\nthe  little  letters  of the text of Part III  de  hors\t the\nDiscovery of India and the Destiny of Bharat or the divinity\nof  the 'soul and the dignity of the person  highlighted  in\nthe Preamble unduly obsessed with individual aberrations  of\nyesteryears or vague hunches leading to current fears, is  a\nparsimonious exercise in constitutional perception.\nThus, the inspirational background. cosmic\t perspective\nand inherited ethos of the pragamtic visionaries and jurist-\nstatesmen  who draw up the great Title Deed of our  Republic\nmust  illumine\tthe sutras of\nArticles 21\n, 19\nand\n14.\nThe\nfascist\t horror of World War II burnt into our\tleaders\t the\nurgency of inscribing indelibly into our Constitution  those\nvalues sans which the dignity of man suffers total  eclipse. The  Universa\nl Declaration of Human Rights, the  resurgence\nof  international fellowship, the vulnerability of  freedoms\neven  in  democracies  and  the\t rapid\tdevelopment  of\t  an\nintegrated and intimately interacting 'one world' poised for\npeaceful  and  progressive  intercourse\t conditioned   their\nthought\t processes.  The bitter feeling of the\tBritish\t Raj\ntrampling  under  foot\tswaraj the  birth-right\t of  every\nIndian- affected their celebrations.  The hidden  divinity\nin   every  human  entity  creatively  impacted\t  upon\t our\nfounding fathers' mentations.

Swami Vivekananda,  that  saintly\nrevolutionary who spanned East and West, exhorted,  dwelling\non the nation's fall of the last century :\n\"My  idea as to the key-note of  our  national\ndownfall\tis  that we do not  mix\t with  other\nnations-that  is the one and sole\t cause.\t  We\nnever  had the opportunity to compare,  notes.\nWe were Kupa-Mandukas (frogs in a well).\"\nx\t\t  x\t       x\t    x\nOne of the great causes of India's misery\t and\ndownfall\thas been that she narrowed  herself,\nwent  into her shell, as the oyster does,\t and\nrefused  to give her jewels and her  treasures\nto the other races of mankind, refused to give\nthe  life\t giving truth to  thirsting  nations\noutside the Aryan fold.  That has been the one\ngreat  cause, that we did not go out, that  we\ndid not compare notes with other\tnations-that\nhas been the one great cause of our  downfall,\nand  every one of you knows that\tthat  little\nstir, the little life you see in India, begins\nfrom  the\t day when Raja\tRammohan  Roy  broke\nthrough  the  walls  of  this   exclusiveness.\nSince that day, history in India has taken an-\nother   turn  and\t now  it  is  growing\twith\naccelerated  motion.   If we have\t bad  little\nrivulets in the past, deluges are coming,\t and\nnone  can resist them.  Therefore, we must  go\nout,  and\t the secret of life is to  give\t and\ntake.   Are we to take always, to sit  at\t the\nfeet  of the Westerners to  learn\t everything,\neven  religion ? We can learn  mechanism\tfrom\nthem.  We can learn many other things.

If you want to  become\nequal with the Englishman or the American, you\nwill  have, to teach as well as to learn,\t and\nyou have plenty yet to teach to the world\t for\ncenturies to come.\"\nFrom the point of view of comparative law too, the  position\nis  well established.  For, one of the essential  attributes\nof   citizenship,  says\t Prof.\t Schwartz,  is\tfreedom\t  of\nmovement.  The right of free movement is a vital element  of\npersonal  liberty.  The right of free movement includes\t the\nright to travel abroad.\t So much is simple textbook teaching\nin  Indian,  as in Anglo-American law.\t Passport  legality,\naffecting  as  it  does, freedoms  that\t are  'delicate\t and\nvulnerable,  as well as supremely precious in our  society',\ncannot\tbut  excite judicial vigilance\tto  obviate  fragile\ndependency for exercise of fundamental rights upon executive\nclemency.   So important is this subject that the  watershed\nbetween\t a police state and a government by the\t people\t may\npartly\tturn on the prevailing passport policy.\t  Conscious,\nthough I am, that such prolix\n720\nelaboration   of  environmental\t aspects  is   otiose,\t the\nEmergency  provsions  of our Constitution, the\textremes  of\nrigour the nation has experienced (or may) and the proneness\nof Power to stoop to conquer make necessitous the  hammering\nhome  of  vital\t values expressed  in  terse  constitutional\nvocabulary.\nAmong the great guaranteed rights, life and liberty are\t the\nfirst\tamong  equals,\tcarrying  a  universal\t connotation\ncardinal   to  a  decent  human\t order\tand   protected\t  by\nconstitutional\t armour.   Truncate  liberty  in\nArt.\t  21\ntraumatically and the several other freedoms fade out  auto-\nmatically.   Justice  Douglas, that most  distinguished\t and\nperhaps\t most  travelled judge in the world, has  in  poetic\nprose and with imaginative realism projected the  functional\nessentiality  of the right to travel as part of liberty.   I\nmay quote for emphasis, what is a woe bit repetitive\n\"The right to travel is a part of 'liberty' of\nwhich  the citizen cannot be deprived  without\ndue   process   of  law\tunder\tthe,   fifth\nAmendment........\t In  Anglo  Saxon  law\tthat\nright  was emerging at least as early  as\t the\nMagna Carta........ Travel abroad, like travel\nwithin  the  country, may be necessary  for  a\nlivelihood.   It may be as close to the  heart\nof  the  individual as the choice of  what  he\neats  or wears or reads.\tFreedom of  movement\nis  basic in our scheme of values.\"  (Kent  v.\nDulles: 357 US 116-2 L. Ed. 2d. 1204 1958).\n\"Freedom\tof  movement also has  large  social\nvalues.\t As   Chafoe  put  it\t:   'Foreign\ncorrespondents  on lectures on public  affairs\nneed  first-hand information.  Scientists\t and\nscholars gain greatly from consultations\twith\ncolleagues in other countries.  Students equip\nthemselves  for more fruitful careers  in\t the\nUnited   States  by  instruction\tin   foreign\nuniversities.  Then there are reasons chose to\nthe  core of personal life-marriage  reuniting\nfamilies,\t spending  hours with  old  friends.\nFinally\ttravel\t abroad\t  enables   American\ncitizens\t to  understand\t that  people\tlike\nthemselves live in Europe and helps them to be\nwell-informed  on public issues.\tAn  American\nwho  has crossed the ocean is not\t obliged  to\nform  his\t opinions about our  foreign  policy\nmerely  from what he is told by  officials  of\nour  Government or by a few correspondents  of\nAmerican\tnewspapers.  Moreover, his views  on\ndomestic questions are enriched by seeing\t how\nforeigners   are\ttrying\tto   solve   similar\nproblems.\t  In  many  different  ways   direct\ncontact  with other countries  contributes  to\nsounder decisions at home....\nFreedom  to  travel is, indeed,  an  important\naspect of the citizen's liberty\".\n(Kent v. Dulles)\n\"Freedom\tof movement at home and\t abroad,  is\nimportant for job and business  opportunities-\nfor cultural, political and social activities-\nfor  all the commingling which gregarious\t man\nenjoys.  Those with the right of free movement\nuse it at times for mischievous purposes.\t But\nthat is true of many liberties we, enjoy.\t  We\nnevertheless place our faith in them and\n721\nagainst  restraint, knowing that the  risk  of\nabusing  liberty\tso  as\tto  give  right\t  to\npunishable conduct is part of the price we pay\nfor this free society.\n(Apthekar v. Secretary of State : 378 US\t500-\n12 L.Ed. 2d 992 (1964).\nJudge Wyzanski has said\n\"This  travel does not differ from  any  other\nexercise\t of   the   manifold   freedoms\t  of\nexpression....... from the right to speak,  to\nwrite,  to  use  the  mails,  to\tpublic,\t  to\nassemble, to petition.\"\n(Wyzanski,   Freedom   to\t  Travel,   Atlantic\nMontaly.\tOct. 1952, p. 66 at 68).\nThe   American\t Courts\t have,\tin  a  sense,\tblazed\t the\nconstitutional trail on that facet of liberty which  relates\nto  untrammelled travel.  Kent, Apthekar and Zemel  are\t the\nlandmark  cases and American jurisprudence today holds as  a\nfundamental part of liberty (V Amendment) that a citizen has\nfreedom\t to  move  across  the\tfrontiers  without  passport\nrestrictions subject, of course, to well-defined necessitous\nexceptions.  Basically, Blackstone is still current coin\n\"Personal\t liberty  consists in the  power  of\nlocomotion,  of changing direction  or  moving\none's  person  to\t whatever  place  one's\t own\ninclination may desire.\"\nTo sum up, personal liberty makes for the worth of the human\nperson.\t  Travel  makes\t liberty  worthwhile.\tLife  is   a\nterrestrial opportunity for unfolding personality, rising to\nhigher\tstates,\t moving to fresh woods and reaching  out  to\nreality\t which makes our earthly journey a true\t fulfilment-\nnot  a tale told by an idiot full of 'sound and fury  signi-\nfying nothing, but a fine frenzy rolling between heaven\t and\nearth.\tThe spirit of Man is at the root of\nArt. 21.\nAbsent\nliberty, other freedoms are frozen.\nWhile  the issue is legal and sounds in the  constitutional,\nits  appreciation  gains in human depth\t given\ta  planetary\nperspective  and  understanding of the\texpanding  range  of\ntravel\tbetween\t the  'inner space' of Man  and\t the  'outer\nspace' around Mother Earth.\nTo conclude this Chapter of the discussion on the concept of\npersonal  liberty, as a sweeping supplement to the  specific\ntreatment by brother Bhagwati J., the Jurists' Conference in\nBangalore, concluded in 1969, made a sound statement of\t the\nIndian\tLaw  subject, of course, to savings  and  exceptions\ncarved out of the generality of that conclusion\n\"Freedom of movement of the individual  within\nor in leaving his own country, in traveling to\nother  countries\tand  in\t entering  his\t own\ncountry is a vital human liberty, whether such\nmovement\tis  for the purpose  of\t recreation,\neducation,  trade or employment, or to  escape\nfrom an environment in\n722\nwhich  his other liberties are  suppressed  or\nthreatened.   Moreover, in an  inter-dependent\nworld  requiring\tfor  its  future  peace\t and\nprogress\t  an   ever-growing    measure\t  of\ninternational  understanding, it is  desirable\nto  facilitate  individual  contacts   between\npeoples\tand  to\t remove\t all   unjustifiable\nrestraints on their movement which may  hamper\nsuch contacts.\"\nSo  much for personal liberty and its travel facet.  Now  to\n'procedure  established by law', the manacle clause in\nArt.\n21\n,  first  generally  and next, with  reference  to\nA.  K.\nGopalan\n(supra)  and  after.\tAgain,\tI  observe  relative\nbrevity because I go the whole bog with brother Bhagwati, J.\nIf\nArticle 21\nincludes the freedom of foreign\ttravel,\t can\nits   exercise\tbe  fettered  or  forbidden   by   procedure\nestablished by law ? Yes, indeed.  So, what is 'procedure' ?\nWhat  do  we  mean  by 'established' ? And  What  is  law  ?\nAnything, formal, legislatively processed, albeit absurd  or\narbitrary  ? Reverence for life and liberty must over  power\nthis  reduction\t an absurdem' Legal interpretation,  in\t the\nlast  analysis, is value judgment.  The high seriousness  of\nthe subject matter-life and liberty-desiderates the need for\nlaw,  not  fiat. law is law when it is\tlegitimated  by\t the\nconscience and consent of the community generally.  Not\t any\ncapricious compthe but reasonable: mode ordinarily  regarded\nby  the\t cream of society as dharma  or\t law,  approximating\nbroadly\t to other standard measures regulating\tcriminal  or\nlike, procedure in the country.\t Often, it is a\t legislative\nact, but it must be functional, not fatuous.\nThis  line of logic alone will make the two clauses of\nArt.\n21\nconcordant, the procedural machinery not destroying\t the\nsubstantive fundamentally.  The compulsion of constitutional\nhumanism  and  the  assumption of full\tfaith  in  life\t and\nliberty\t cannot\t be,  so  futile  or  fragmentary  that\t any\ntransient  legislative\tmajority  in  tantrums\tagainst\t any\nminority,  by  three  quick  readings of  a  bill  with\t the\nrequisite  quorum; can prescribe any  unreasonable  modality\nand thereby sterilise the grandiloquent mandate.  'Procedure\nestablished  by\t law', with its\t lethal\t potentiality,\twill\nreduce\tlife and liberty to a precarious plaything if we  do\nnot  ex\t necessitate  import into those\t weighty  words\t an,\nadjectival  rule of law, civilised in its soul, fair in\t its\nheart and fixing those imperatives of procedural  protection\nabsent\twhich the processual tail will wag  the\t substantive\nhead.\tCan the sacred essence of the human right to  secure\nwhich  the  struggle  for  liberation,\twith  'do  or\tdie'\npatriotism,  was  launched  be\tsapped\tby  formalistic\t and\npharisaic prescriptions, regardless of essential standards ?\nAn   enacted  apperition  is  a\t  constitutional   illusion.\nProcessual  justice is writ patently on\nArt. 21.\nIt is\t too\ngrave to be circumvented by a black letter ritual  processed\nthrough the legislature.\nSo  I am convinced that to frustrate\nArt. 21\nby relying\t on\nany formal adjectival statute, however, filmsy or  fantastic\nits   provisions  be,  is  to  rob  what  the\tconstitution\ntreasures.   Procedure\twhich deals with the  modalities  of\nregulating,  restricting  or even  rejecting  a\t fundamental\nright falling within,\nArt. 21\nhas to be fair, riot  foolish,\ncarefully\n723\ndesigned  to,  effectuate. not to subvert,  the\t substantive\nright  itself.\tThus understood, 'procedure' must  rule\t out\nanything   arbitrary  freakish\tor  bizarre.\tA   valuable\nconstitutional\tright  can be canalised\t only  by  civilised\nprocesses.  You cannot claim that it is a legal procedure if\nthe passport is granted or refused by taking loss, ordeal of\nfire  or  by other strange or mystical methods.\t Nor  is  it\ntenable\t if life is taken by a crude or summary\t process  of\nenquiry.  What is fundamental is life and liberty.  What  is\nprocedural is the manner of its exercise,.  This quality  of\nfairness  in  the process is emphasised by the\tstrong\tword\n,established  which  means  'settled  firmly  not   wantonly\nwhimsically.\nIf it is rooted in the legal consciousness  of\nthe  community\tit becomes '  established'  procedure.\t And\n'Law'  leaves  little doubt that it is normae,\tregarded  as\njust since law is the means and justice is the end.\nIs there supportive judicial thought for this reasoning.  We\ngo back to the vintage words of the learned Judges in\nA.  K.\nGopalan\n(supra)  and zigzag through R. C. Cooper to  S.  N.\nSarkar and discern attestation of this conclusion.  And\t the\nelaborate   constitutional  procedure  in\nArt.\t 22\nitself\nfortifies  the argument that 'life and liberty' in\nArt.  21\ncould\tnot   have  been  left\t to   illusory\t legislators\nhappenstance.  Even as relevant reasonableness informs\nart.\n14\nand\n19\n, the component of fairness is implicit in\nArt. 21.\nA  close-up  of the\nGopalan\ncase (supra) is  necessitous  at\nthis  stage to underscore the quality of procedure  relevant\nto personal liberty.\nProcedural  safeguards\tare  the  indispensable\t essence  of\nliberty.  In fact, the history of personal liberty is  large\nthe history of procedural safeguards and right to a  hearing\nhas  a human-right ring.  In India, because of\tpoverty\t and\nilliteracy,  the  people are unable to\tprotect\t and  defend\ntheir  rights;\tobservance  of\tfundamental  rights  is\t not\nregarded  as good politics and their transgression  as\thad\npolitics.   I  sometimes  pensively  reflect  that  people's\nmilitant   awareness  of  rights  and  duties  is  a   surer\nconstitutional\tassurance of governmental respect  and\tres-\nponse than the sound and fury of the 'question hour' and the\nslow   and   unsure  delivery  of  court   writ\t  'Community\nConsciousness  and the Indian Constitution is a\t fascinating\nsubject of sociological relevance in many areas.\nTo  sum\t up, 'procedure' in\nArt. 21\nmeans fair,\t not  formal\nprocedure.  'Law' is reasonable law, not any enacted  piece.\nAs\nArt.  22\n,specifically  spells  out   the\t  procedural\nsafeguards  for\t preventive and punitive  detention,  a\t law\nproviding for such detentions should conform to\nArt. 22.\nIt\nhas  been rightly pointed out that for other rights  forming\npart   of  personal  liberty,  the   procedural\t  safeguards\nenshrined  in\nArt.  21\nare available.\t Otherwise,  as\t the\nprocedural safeguards contained in\nArt. 22\nwill be available\nonly  in  cases of preventive and  punitive  detention,\t the\nright to life, more fundamental than any other forming\tpart\nof personal liberty and paramount to the happiness,  dignity\nand  worth  of the individual, will not be entitled  to\t any\nprocedural  safeguard  save  such as  a\t legislature's\tmood\nchooses.    In,\t  Kochunni(1)  the   Court,   doubting\t the\ncorrectness of the Gopalan decision on this aspect, said :\n(1)  A. I. R. 1960 S. C. 1080,1093.\n724\n.lm15\n\"Had  the question been res integra, some of us\t would\thave\nbeen inclined to agree with the dissenting view expressed by\nFazal Ali, J.\"\nGopalan\t does  contain some luscent  thought  on  'Procedure\nestablished  by law'.  Patanjali Sastri, J. approximated  it\nto the prevalent norms of criminal procedure regarded for  a\nlong time by Indo-Anglian criminal law as conscionable.\t The\nlearned Judge observed :\n\"On   the\t other\thand,\tthe   interpretation\nsuggested by the Attorney General on behalf of\nthe  intervener  that  the  expression   means\nnothing more than procedure prescribed by\t any\nlaw made by a competent legislature is  hardly\nmore acceptable.\t'Established', according  to\nhim,  means prescribed, and if  Parliament  or\nthe  Legislature of a State enacted  a  proce-\ndure,   however  novel  and  ineffective\t for\naffording\t  the\taccused\t  person   a\tfair\nopportunity of defending himself, it would  be\nsufficient for depriving a person of his\tlife\nof personal liberty.\"\n(pp. 201-203)\n\"The  main difficulty I feel in accepting\t the\nconstruction suggested by the Attorney General\nis that it completely stultifies\narticle 13(2)\nand,   indeed,  the  very\t conception   of   a\nfundamental  right........ could it then\thave\nbeen  the\t intention  of the  framers  of\t the\nConstitution    that   the   most\t   important\nfundamental   rights  to\tlife  and   personal\nliberty should be at the mercy of\t legislative\nmajorities  as,  in  effect,  they  would\t  if\n'established' were to mean merely prescribed ?\nIn other words, as an American Judge said in a\nsimilar\tcontext,  does\tthe   constitutional\nprohibition  in\narticle 13(3)\namount  to\t 'no\nmore  than 'your shall not take away  life  or\npersonal freedom unless you choose to take  it\naway,  which is more verbiage.........  It  is\nsaid  that\narticle 21\naffords  no  protection\nagainst  competent legislative action  in\t the\nfield  of substantive criminal law, for  there\nis  no provision for judicial review,  on\t the\nground of reasonableness or otherwise, of such\nlaws, as in the case of the rights  enumerated\nin\narticle 19.\nEven assuming it to be so\t the\nconstruction  of the learned  Attorney  Genera\nl\nwould  have  the effect  of  rendering  wholly\nineffective  and illusory even the  procedural\nprotection  which the article was\t undoubtedly\ndesigned to afford.\"\n(p. 202) (emphasis, added)\n\"After  giving the matter my most careful\t and\nanxious  consideration,  I have  come  to\t the\nconclusion  that there are only  two  possible\nsolutions of the problem.\t In the first place,\na\t satisfactory  via  media  between  the\t two\nextreme positions contended for on either side\nmay   be\t found\t by   stressing\t  the\tword\n'established'  which  implies some  degree  of\nfirmness,\t permanence and general\t acceptance,\nwhile  it\t does  not  exclude  origination  by\nstatute.\t'Procedure esta-\n725\nblished by' may well be taken to mean what the\nPrivy  Council referred to in\nKing Emperor  v.\nBengori  Lal Sharma\nas 'the ordinary and\twell\nestablished  criminal procedure', that  is  to\nsay, those settled usages and normal modes  of\nproceeding   sanctioned\tby   the\nCriminal\nProcedure\t Code\nwhich is the general  law of\nCriminal procedure in the country.\n(p. 205)\nFazal  Ali,  J.\t frowned  on  emasculating  the\t  procedural\nsubstantiality of\nArt. 21\nand read into it those  essentials\nof  natural justice which made processual law humane  :\t The\nteamed Judge argued :\n\"It   seems  to  me  that\t there\tis   nothing\nrevolutionary  in the doctrine that the  words\n'Procedure  established by law'  must  include\nthe  four\t principles  set  out  in  Professor\nWillis' book, which, as I have already stated,\nare  different aspects of the  same  principle\nand  which  have no vagueness  or\t uncertainty\nabout them.  These principles, as the  learned\nauthor points out and as the authorities show,\nare  not absolutely rigid principles  but\t are\nadaptable\t to the circumstances of  each\tcase\nwithin  certain limits.  I have only  to\tadd,\nthat  it has not been  seriously\tcontroverted\nthat  'law'  means certain definite  rules  of\nproceeding  and not something which is a\tmere\npretence for procedure.\n(emphasis, added)\nIn short, fair adjectival law is the very life of the  life-\nliberty\t fundamental  right  (\nArt.  21\n),  'not\t 'autocratic\nsupremacy   of\tthe  legislature'.   Mahajan  J.  struck   a\nconcordant note :\n\"\nArticle\t 21\n'in  my  opinion,\t lays\tdown\nsubstantive law as giving protection to'\tlife\nand  liberty in as much as it says  that\tthey\ncannot  be  deprived except according  to\t the\nprocedure established by law; in other  words,\nit means that before a person can be  deprived\nof   his\tlife  or  liberty  as  a   condition\nprecedent there should exist some\t substantive\nlaw conferring authority for doing so and\t the\nlaw  should  further  provide for\t a  mode  of\nprocedure for such deprivation., This articles\ngives  complete immunity against the  exercise\nof  despotic  power  by  the  executive.\t  It\nfurther  gives immunity against  invalid\tlaws\nwhich  contravene the Constitution.  It  gives\nalso  further  guarantee\tthat  in  its\ttrue\nconcept\tthere\tshould\tbe  some   form\t  of\nproceeding  before a person can  be  condemned\neither in respect of his life or his  liberty.\nIt negatives the idea of a fantastic arbitrary\nand oppressive form of proceedings.\"\n(emphasis, added)\nIn  sum,  Fazal Ali, J. struck the chord which\tdoes  accord\nwith a just processual system where liberty is likely to  be\nthe victim.  May be, the learned Judge stretched it a little\nbeyond\t the  line  but\t in  essence  his  norms  claim\t  my\nconcurrence.\n8-119 SCI/78\n726\nIn John v. Rees(1) the true rule, as implicit in any law, is\nset down\n\"If  there is any doubt, the applicability  of\nthe  principles will be given the\t benefit  of\ndoubt.\"\nAnd  Lord  Denning,  on the theme of  liberty,\tobserved  in\nSchmidt V.

No  Passport  Officer\nshall  be  mini-Caesar nor Minister incarnate  Caesar  in  a\nsystem where the rule of law reigns supreme.\nMy clear conclusion on\nArt. 21\nis that liberty of locomotion\ninto  alien  territory cannot be unjustly forbidden  by\t the\nEstablishment and passport legislation must take  processual\nprovisions   which  accord  with  fair\tnorms,\t free\tfrom\nextraneous  pressure  and,  by\tand  large,  complying\twith\nnatural justice.  Unilateral arbitrariness, police dossiers,\nfaceless   affiants,  behind-the-back\tmaterials,   oblique\nmotives\t and the inscrutable face of an official  sphinx  do\nnot  fill  the 'fairness' bill-subject, of course,  to\tjust\nexceptions  and critical contexts.

And Tom Paine, in his  Dissertation  on\nFirst Principles of Government, sounded the tossin:\n\"He  that would make, his own  liberty  secure\nmost guard even his enemy from oppression; for\nif  he  violates this duty, he  establishes  a\nprecedent that will reach to himself.\"\nPhoney freedom is not worth the word and this ruling of ours\nis  not\t confined to the petitioner but to the\thungry\tjob-\nseeker,\t nun  and  nurse, mason and  carpenter,\t welder\t and\nfitter\tand,  above  all, political  dissenter.\t  The.\tlast\ncategory,  detested as unreasonable, defies  the  Establish-\nment's\ttendency  to enforce through conformity but  is\t the\nresource of social change.  \"The reasonable man\", says G. B.\nShaw;\n.lm15\n\" adapts himself to the word; the unreasonable one  persists\nin  trying  to adapt the world to himself.   Therefore,\t all\nprogress  depends on the unreasonable man.\" (George  Bernard\nShaw in 'Maxims for Revolutionists').\n'Passport' peevishness is a suppressive possibility, and  so\nthe  words  of Justice Jackson (U.S. Supreme Court)  may  be\napposite:\n\"Freedom\tto differ is not limited  to  things\nthat do not matter much.\tThat would be a mere\nshadow  of freedom.\t The test of its  substanc\ne\nis the right to differ as to things that touch\nthe heart of the existing order.\"\n(West  Yirginia  State Board of  Education  v.\nBarnetto 319 US 624 (1943).\nUnder our constitutional order, the price of daring  dissent\nshall not be passport forfeit.\nThe  impugned legislation, ss. 5, 6 and 10 especially,\tmust\nbe tested even under\nArt. 21\non canons of processual justice\nto  the\t people\t outlined  above.

But soon after the provisional seizure, a\nreasonable  hearing  must  follow,  to\tminimise  procedural\nprejudice.   And when a prompt final order is  made  against\nthe  applicant\tor  passport  holder  the  reasons  must  be\ndisclosed  to him almost invariably save in those  dangerous\ncases  where irreparable injury will ensue to the State.   A\ngovernment which reveals in secrecy in the field of people's\nliberty not only acts against democratic decency but  busies\nitself with its own burial.  That is the writing on the wall\nif  history were teacher, memory our mentor and\t decline  of\nliberty\t not  our unwitting endeavour.\t Public\t power\tmust\nrarely hide its heart in an open society and system.\n728\nI now skip\nArt.14\nsince I agree fully with all that  my\nlearned brother Bhagwati J.has\tsaid. That article has\ta\nPervasive processual  potency and versatilequality,\negalitarian  in\t its  soul and\tallergic  to  discriminatory\ndiktats.Equality  is the, antithesis of arbitrariness  and\nexcathedra   ipse   dixit   is\t the   ally   of   demagogic\nauthoritarianism.    Only   knight-errants   of\t  'executive\nexcesses'-if  we may use a current cliche--can fall in\tlove\nwith the Dame, of despotism, legislative or  administrative.\nIf  this Court gives in here it gives up the ghost.  And  so\nit  that  I  insist  on\t the  dynamics\tof  limitations\t  on\nfundamental  freedoms as implying the rule of law;  Be\tyou,\never so high, the law is above you.'\nA  minor pebble was thrown to produce a little\tripple.\t  It\nwas feebly suggested that the right to travel abroad  cannot\nbe  guaranteed\tby  the\t State\tbecause\t it  has  no  extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction in foreign lands.  This is a  naive\nmisconception  of  the\tpoint  pressed\tbefore\tus.   Nobody\ncontends  that India should interfere with  other  countries\nand their sovereignty to ensure free movement of Indians  in\nthose  countries.  What is meant is that the  Government  of\nIndia  should not prevent by any sanctions it has  over\t its\ncitizens from moving within any other country if that  other\ncountry\t has  no objection to their  travelling\t within\t its\nterritory.  It\tis  difficult  to  understand  how  one\t can\nmisunderstand  the obvious.\nA thorny problem debated  recurrently at the bar, turning on\nArt.  19\n, demands some juristic response although  avoidance\nof  overlap  per-  suades me to\t drop  all  other  questions\ncanvassed  before us.\nThe Gopalan\n(supra) verdict, with\t the\ncocooning  of\nArt.  22\ninto a\t self  contained  code,\t has\nsuffered supersession at the hands of R. C. Cooper(1)..\t  By\nway  of\t aside,\t the fluctuating   fortunes  of\t fundamental\nrights, when   the  proletarist and the\t proprietariat\thave\nasserted  them\tin  Court,  partially  provoke\tsociological\nresearch  and hesitantly project the Cardozo thesis of\tsub-\nconscious  forces  in judicial noesis  when  the  cycloramic\nreview\tstarts\tfrom  Gopalan, moves on to In  re  :  Kerala\nEducation  Bill\t and  then on to All  India  Bank  Employees\nUnion,\tnext to Sakai Newspapers, crowning in Cooper(1)\t and\nfollowed  by Bennet Coleman(2) and Sambu Nath Sarkar(3).  Be\nthat  as it may, the law is now settled, as I apprehend\t it,\nthat  no  article  in Part III is an island but\t part  of  a\ncontinent,  and the conspectus of the whole part  gives\t the\ndirections and correction needed for interpretation of these\nbasic provisions. Man is not dissectible into separate limbs\nand,  likewise, cardinal rights in an organic  constitution,\nwhich  make man human have a synthesis.

It is a salutary thought that the summit  court\nshould not interpret constitutional rights enshrined in Part\nIII  to\t choke its life-breath or chill its  elan  vital  by\nprocesses  of  legalism,  overruling  the  enduring   values\nburning in the bosoms of those who won our Independence\t and\ndrew  up our founding document.\t We must also remember\tthat\nwhen  this  Court lays down the law, not ad  hoc  tunes\t but\nessential  notes,  not temporary tumult\t but  transcendental\ntruth,\tmust guide the judicial process in translating\tinto\nauthoritative notation the mood music of the Constitution.\nWhile  dealing\twith\nArt. 19\nvis a vis\t freedom  to  travel\nabroad,\t we  have to remember one spinal  indicator.   True,\nhigh   constitutional  policy  has   harmonised\t  individual\nfreedoms   with\t holistic  community  good   by\t  inscribing\nexception's  to\nArt. 19(1)\nin\nArt. 19(2)\nto (6).   Even\t so,\nwhat is fundamental is the freedom, not the exception.\tMore\nimportantly,  restraints are permissible only to the  extent\nthey have nexus with the approved object.  For instance,  in\na  wide\t sense, 'the interests of the  general\tpublic'\t are\nserved\tby  a  family  planning\t programme  but\t it  may  be\nconstitutional impertinence to insist that passports may  be\nrefused\t if  sterilisation certificates were  not  produced.\nLikewise,  it  is  in public interest to  widen\t streets  in\ncities\tbut  monstrous\tto impound a  passport\tbecause\t its\nholder\thas  declined to demolish his house  which  projects\ninto  the  street line.\t Sure, the security of\tState  is  a\nparamount  consideration  but  can  Govemment,\ttotalitarian\nfashion.  cquate Part,, country and refuse  travel  document\nbecause,  while\t abroad, he may\t criticise  the\t conflicting\npolitics of the Party-in-power or the planning economics  of\nthe government of the day?  Is it conceivable that an Indian\nwill  forfeit  his right to go abroad  because\this  flowing\nside-bums or sartorial vagaries offend a high-placed  autho-\nrity's\tsense of decency ? The point is that liberty can  be\ncurtailed  only\t if the grounds listed in  the\tsaving\tsub-\narticles  are  directly,  specifically,\t substantially\t and\nimminently  attracted  so that the basic right\tmay  not  be\nstultified.   Restraints are necessary and validly  made  by\nstatute,  but to paint with an over-broad brush a  power  to\nblanketban  travel  abroad  is to sweep\t overly\t and  invade\nillicitly.   'The  law\tof  fear'  cannot  reign  where\t the\nproportionate  danger  is containable.\tIt  is\ta  balancing\nprocess,  not over-weighted one way or the other.  Even\t so,\nthe perspective is firm and fair.  Courts must not interfere\nwhere the order is not perverse, unreasonable, mala fide  or\nsupported  by  no material.  Under our system,\tcourt  writs\ncannot\trun government, for, then, judicial review may\ttend\nto  be\ta judicial coup.  But 'lawless'\t law  and  executive\nexcess\tmust be halted by judge-power best the\tConstitution\nbe  subverted  by  branches deriving  credentials  from\t the\nConstitution.\tAn imperative guideline by which  the  Court\nwill  test  the\t soundness  of\tlegislative  and   executive\nconstraint is, in the. language of V.

For,\t if unchecked, 'the greater the\t power,\t the\nmore dangerous the abuse.' To deny freedom of travel or exit\nto one untenably is to deny it to any or many likewise,\t and\nthe  right to say 'Aye' or 'nay' to any potential  traveller\nshould,\t therefore, not rest with the minions or masters  of\ngovernment  without  being gently and benignly\tcensored  by\nconstitutionally sanctioned legislative norms if the reality\nof liberty is not be drowned in the hysteria of the hour  or\nthe hubris of power.  It is never trite to repeat that where\nlaws end, tyranny begins', and law becomes. unlaw even if it\nis legitimated by three legislative readings and one assent,\nif  it\tis  not in accord  with\t constitutional\t provisions,\nbeyond\tabridgement by the two branches of  government.\t  In\nthe  context  of scray expressions like\t 'security'  'public\norder,\t'public interest' and 'friendly foreign\t relations',\nwe  must  warn\tourselves that not verbal  tables  but\treal\nvalues\tare the governing considerations in the\t exploration\nand   adjudication  of\tconstitutional\t prescriptions\t and\nproscriptions.\tGovernments come and go, but the fundamental\nrights of the people cannot be subject to the wishful value-\nsets of political regimes of the passing day.\nThe learned Attorney General argued that the right to travel\nabroad\twas no part of\nArt. 19(1) (a)\n, (b), (c), (f) or\t (g)\nand so to taboo travel even unreasonably does not touch Art.\n19.   As  a component thereof, as also by  way\tof  separate\nsubmission,  it\t was  urged that the direct  effect  of\t the\npassport  law  (and refusal thereunder) was not\t a  blow  on\nfreedom\t of  speech, of association or\tof  profession\tand,\ntherefore, it could not be struck down even if it overflowed\nArt. 19(2)\n, (4)\nand\n(6).\nThis presentation poses the issue,\n'What  is the profile 'of our free system ?' Is\t freedom  of\nspeech integrally interwoven with locomotion ? Is freedom of\nprofession  done  to death if a\t professional,\tby  passport\nrefusal without reference to\nArt. 19 (f )\n, is inhibited from\ntaking\tup a job offered abroad ? is freedom of\t association\nsuch  a hot-house plant that membership of an  international\nprofessional  or  political Organisation can be cut  off  on\nexecutive-legislative  ipse dixit without obedience to\nArt.\n19(4) ?\n731\nThis   renophatic  touch  has  not  been  attested  by\t the\nConstitution and is not discernible in the psyche.  An anti-\ninternational  pathology  shall\t not  afflict  our  National Charter.\tA\nHuman Tomorrow on Mother Earth is  our\tcosmic\nconstitutional perspective (See\nArt. 51\nTo. my mind, locomotion is, in some situation,\tnecessarily.\ninvolved in the exercise of the specified fundamental rights\nas an associated or integrated right.  Travel,\tsimiplicter,\nis peripheral to and not necessarily fundamental in\nArt. 19.\nArguendo,  free speech is feasible without  movement  beyond\nthe country, although soilequies and solo songs are not the\nvogue  in  this ancient land of silent saints  and  pyrating\ngurus, bhajans and festivals.  Again, travel may  ordinarily\nbe 'action and only incidentally 'expression', to borrow the\nZemel diction.\nMovement within the territory of India is not tampered\twith\nby  the\t impugned order, but that is not all.  For,  if\t our\nnotions\t are en current, it is common place that the  world-\nthe family of nations--vibrates, and men-masses of  man-move\nand  'jet' abroad and abroad, even in Concorde, on  a  scale\nunknown\t to history.  Even thoughts, ideologies\t and  habits\ntravel\tbeyond.\t Tourists crowd out airline  services;\tjob-\nseekers\t rush to passport offices; lecture  tours,  cultural\nexchanges, trans-national evangelical meets, scientific\t and\nscholarly  studies and workshops and seminars escalate,\t and\ninternational associations abound-all for the good of  world\npeace and human progress, save where are involved high risks\nto  sovereignty,  national security  and  other\t substantial\nconsiderations\twhich Constitutions and Courts have  readily\nrecognised.   Our free system is not so brittle or  timorous\nas to be scared into tabooing citizens trips abroad, except\nconducted tours or approved visits sanctioned by the Central\nExecutive  and\tindifferent  to\nArt. 19.\nAgain,  the\tcore\nquestion  arises, Is movement abroad so much a crucial\tpart\nof  free  speech, free practice of profession and  the\tlike\nthat denial of the first is a violation of the rest?\nI  admit that merely because speaking mostly  involves\tsome\nmovement,  therefore, 'free speech anywhere is dead if\tfree\nmovement  everywhere  is  denied',  does  not  follow.\t The\nConstitutional lines must be so drawn that the constellation\nof  fundamental rights does not expose the  peace,  security\nand  tranquillity of the community to high risk.  We  cannot\nover-stretch   free  speech  to\t make  it  an\tinextricable\ncomponent of travel.\nThomas\tEmerson\t has summed the American Law which  rings  a\nbell even in the Indian system :\n\"The  values and functions of the\t freedom  of\nexpression in a democratic polity are obvious.\nFreedom  of  expression is  essentially  as  a\nmeans of assuring individual  self-fulfilment.\nThe  proper end of man is the  realisation  of\nhis  character and potentialities as  a  human\nbeing.   For  the achievement  of\t this  self-\nrealisation the mind must be free.\" Again\n732\n\"Freedom of expression is an essential process\nfor advancing knowledge and discovering truth.\nSo  also for participation in  decision-making\nin   a   democratic  society.    Indeed\tfree\nexpression furthers stability in the community\nby  reasoning  together  instead\tof  battling\nagainst each other.  Such being the value\t and\nfunction of free speech, what are the dynamics\nof limitation which will fit these values and\nfunctions\t without retarding social  goals  or\ninjuring\tsocial\tinterest  ? It\tis  in\tthis\nbackground that we have to view the problem of\npassports and the law woven around it.   There\nare  two ways of looking at the question\t....\nas  a  facet of liberty and as an\t ancient  of\nexpression.\"   Thomas  Emerson   comments\t  on\npassports from these dual angles :\nTravel abroad should probably be classified as\n'action'\t rather\t  than\t \"expression\".\t  In\ncommonsense  terms  travel  is  more  physical\nmovement\tthan communication of ideas.  It  is\ntrue   that   travel  abroad   is\t  frequently\ninstrumental  to\texpression, as\twhen  it  is\nundertaken  by a reporter to gather  news',  a\nscholar  to  lecture,  a\tstudent\t to   obtain\ninformation  or simply an ordinary citizen  in\norder  to\t expand\t his  understanding  of\t the\nworld.  Nevertheless, there are so many  other\naspects  to travel abroad on  functionally  it\nrequires\tsuch different types  of  regulation\nthat,  at last as the general proposition,  it\nwould  have  to be  considered  \"action\".\t  As\naction, it is a 'liberty' protected by the due\nprocess  clause  of the Fifth  and  Fourteenth\nAmendments.   The\t first\tamendment  is  still\nrelevant\t in  two  ways\t:  (1)\t There\t are\nsufficient  elements of expression in  travel,\nabroad  so  that the umbrella effect  of\ttile\nfirst  Amendment\tcomes  into  play,   thereby\nrequiring the courts to apply due process\t and\nother  constitutional doctrines  with  special\ncare; (2) conditions imposed on travel  abroad\nbased  on\t conduct  classified  as  expression\nimpair  freedom of expression and hence  raise\ndirect first Amendment questions.\"\nTravel\tis  more  than speech : it is  speech  bridged\twith\nconduct, in the words of Justice Douglas:\n\"Restrictions on the right to travel in  times\nof  peace should be so particularized that  at\nFirst Amendment right is not precluded  unless\nsome  clear countervailing  national  interest\nstands in the way. of its assertion.\"\nI  do not take this. as wholly valid in our Part III  scheme\nbut refer to it as kindred reasoning.\nThe  delicate,\tyet  difficult,\t phase\tof  the\t controversy\narrives\t where free speech and free practice  of  profession\nare   inextricably  interwoven\twith  travel  abroad.\nThe\nPassport Act\n, in terms, does not inhibit expression and only\nregulates action-to borrow the phraseology of Chief  Justice\nWarren in Zemel.  But we have to view the proximate and real\nconservance of thwarting trans-national travel through the\n733\npower of the State exercised under\ns. 3\nof the Passport\t Act\nread, A with\nss. 5\n,\n6\nand\n10\n.  If a right is not in  express\nterms  fundamental within the meaning of Part III, does\t it\nescape\nArt. 13\n, read with the trammels of\nArt. 19\n, even  if\nthe immediate impact, the substantial ,effect, the proximate\nimport or the necessary result is prevention of free  speech\nor  practice  of one's profession ? The answer is  that\t as-\nsociated  rights,  totally integrated, must enjoy  the\tsame\nimmunity.  Not\totherwise.\nThree  sets of cases may be thought of.\t Firstly, where\t the\nlegislative  provision or executive order expressly  forbids\nexercise  in  foreign lands of the fundamental\tright  while\ngrunting passport.  Secondly, there may be cases where\teven\nif  the\t order\tis- innocent on its  face,  the\t refusal  of\npermission  to go to a foreign country may,  with  certainty\nand immediacy, spell denial of free speech and\tprofessional\npractice  or business.\tThirdly, the fundamental  right\t may\nitself\t enwomb\t  locomotion  regard-.\tless   of   national\nfrontiers.  The second and third often are blurred in  their\nedges and may overlap.\nThe  first  class  may\tbe  illustrated.   If  the  passport\nauthority  specifically\t conditions the\t permission  with  a\ndirection  not\tto address meetings abroad or not  to  be  a\njournalist  or\tprofessor in a foreign\tcountry,  the  order\nviolate\nArt. 19(1) (a)\nor (f) and stands voided unless\nArt.\n19  (2)\nand\n(6)\nare complied with.  The second category\t may\nbe exemplified and examined after the third which is of less\nfrequent  occurrence.\tIf  'a person  is  an  international\npilot,\tastronaut,  Judge.  of the  International  Court  of\nJustice, Secretary of the World Peace Council, President  of\na  body of like nature, the particular profession  not\tonly\ncalls  for its practice travelling outside Indian  territory\nbut  its  core itself is international travel.\tIn  such  an\narea,  no  right  of  exit, no\tpractice  of  profession  or\nvocation.  Similarly, a cricketer or tennis player recruited\non  a  world  tour.  Free speech may  similarly\t be  bit  by\nrestriction  on\t a  campaigner for  liberation\tof  colonial\npeoples\t or against  genocide before  the  United  Nations\nOrganisation.\tRefusal in such cases is hit on the head  by\nnegation  of a national passport and can be rescued only  by\ncompliance  With  the relevant saving provisions ,  in\nArt.\n19(2)\n, (4)\nor (6).\nSo  far is plain sailing, as I see it.\tBut  the  navigation\ninto the penumbral zone of the second category is not easy.\nI  Supposing  a\t lawyer\t or  doctor,  expert  or   exporter,\nmissionary   or\t guru,\thas  to\t visit\ta  foreign   country\nprofession-ally\t  or  on  a  speaking  assignment.   He\t  is\neffectively   disabled\tfrom  discharging  his\tpursuit\t  if\npassport is refused.  There the direct effect, the necessary\nconsequence, the immediate impact of the embargo on grant of\npassport (or its subsequent impounding or revocation) is the\ninfringement  of  the right to\texpression  or\tprofession'.\nSuch infraction is unconstitutional unless the relevant part\nof\nArt.  19 (2)\nto (6) is complied With.  In  dealing\twith\nfundamental  freedom  substantial justification\t alone\twill\nbring  the  law under the  exceptions.\t National  security,\nsovereignty,  public  order and public interest must  be  of\nsuch  a\t high  degree as to offer  a  great  threat.   These\nconcepts should not be devalued to suit\n734\nthe  hyper-sensitivity  of\t the  executive\t or  minimal\nthreats\t to the State.\tOur, nation is not so  pusillanimous\nor precarious as to fall or founder. if some miscreants pelt\nstones\tat its fair face from foreign countries.   The\tdogs\nmay  bark, but the caravan will pass.  And the danger  to  a\nparty  in power is not the same as rocking the\tsecurity  or\nsovereignty of the, State.  Sometimes, a petulant government\nwhich  forces silence may act unconstitutionally  to  forbid\ncriticism from far, even if necessary for    the good of the\nState.\t The perspective of free criticism with\t its  limits\nfor  free people everywhere, all true patriots will  concur,\nis  eloquently\tspelt out by Sir Winston  Churchill  on\t the\nhistoric  censure  motion  in the  Commons  as\tBritain\t was\nreeling under defeat at the hands of Hitlerite hordes :\n\"This  long debate has now reached  its  final\nstage.  What a remarkable example it, has been\nof the unbridled freedom of our  Parliamentary\ninstitutions  in time of war  Everything\tthat\ncould be thought of or raked up has been\tused\nto  weaken confidence in the  Government,\t has\nbeen   used  to  prove  that   Ministers\t are\nincompetent and to weaken their confidence  in\nthemselves,  to  make the\t Army  distrust\t the\nbacking it is getting from the civil power, to\nmake  workmen lose confidence in\tthe  weapons\nthey are striving so hard to, make, to present\nthe  Government as a set of non-entities\tover\nwhom  the Prime Minister towers, and  then  to\nundermine\t him  in  his  own  heart,  and,  if\npossible, before the eyes of the nation.\t All\nthis  poured  out by cable and  radio  to\t all\nparts of the world, to the distress of all our\nfriends and to the delight of all our foes   I\nam  in favour of this freedom, which no  other\ncountry would use, or dare to use, in times of\nmortal  peril such as those through  which  we\nare passing.\"\nI wholly agree that spies, traitors, smugglers, saboteurs of\nthe health, wealth and survival or sovereignty of the nation\nshall  not  be passported into hostile soil  to\t work  their\nvicious\t plan fruitfully.  But when applying  the\nPassports\nAct\n,  over-breadth hyper-anxiety,  regimentation    complex,\nand political mistrust shall not sub-consciously exaggerate,\ninto morbid or neurotic refusal or unlimited impounding\t or-\nfinal  revocation  of  passport,  facts\t which,\t objectively\nassessed,  may\tprove tremendous trifles.  That is  why\t the\nprovisions  have  to be read  down  into  constitutionality,\ntailored  to  fit the reasonableness test and  humanised  by\nnatural\t justice.\nThe Act\nwill survive but the order  shall\nperish\tfor  reasons  so  fully\t set  out  by  Shri  Justice\nBhagwati.  And, on this construction, the conscience of\t the\nConstitution  triumphs over vagarious  governmental  orders.\nAnd,   indeed,\tthe  learned  Attorney\tGeneral\t  (and\t the\nAdditional  Solicitor General who appeared with\t him),\twith\ncharacteristic\tand  commendable grace\tand  perceptive\t and\nprogressive  realism, agreed to the happy resolution of\t the\npresent\t dispute  in  the  manner  set\tout  in\t my  learned\nbrother's judgment.\nA concluding caveat validating my detour.  Our country,\t its\nhopes,\tall its tears and all its fears, must  never  forget\nthat  freedom is recreated year by year, that freedom is  as\nfreedom does, that we have gained a republic 'if we can keep\nit' and that the water-\n735\nshed  between a police state and a people's raj\t is  located\npartly\tthrough its passport policy.  Today, a poor  man  in\nthis poor country despaire of getting a passport because  of\ninvariable   police   enquiry,\t insistence   on    property\nrequirement  and other avoidable procedural obstacles.\t And\nif  a system of secret informers, police dossiers,  faceless\nwhisperers  and political tale-bearers\tconceptualised\t'and\ninstitutionalised 'in public interest,' comes to stay, civil\nliberty\t is  legisidally  constitutionalised--a\t consumption\nconstantly to be resisted.  The merits of a particular\tcase\napart, the policing of a people's right of exit or entry  is\nfraught\t with  peril to liberty unless\tpolicy\tis  precise,\noperationally respectful of recognised values and harassment\nproof.\t Bertrand Russel has called attention to a  syndrome\nthe Administration will do well to note :\n\"We  are all of us a mixture, of good and\t bad\nimpulses\tthat  prevail in an  excited  crowd.\nThere  is in most men an impulse to  persecute\nwhatever is felt to be 'different'.  There  is\nalso  a  haired of any claim  to\tsuperiority,\nwhich  makes  the stupid many hostile  to\t the\nintelligent  few.\t  A motive such as  fear  of\ncommunism\t affords what seems a  decent  moral\nexcuse for a combination of the heard  against\neverything in any way exceptional.  This is  a\nrecurrent\t  phenomenon   in   human   history.\nWherever it occurs, its results are horrible.\"\n(Foreword by Bertrand Russel to Freedom is  as\nFreedom Does-Civil Liberties Today-by  Corliss\nLament.  New York, 1956)\nWhile interpreting and implementing the words of\nArt. 14\n, 19\nand\n21\n, we may keep J. B. Preistley's caution :\n\"We do not imagine that we are the victims  of\nplots, that bad men are doing all this.  It is\nthe machinery of power that is getting out  of\nsane  control.

K-869668\nwas  issued to you by this office, on  1-6-76.\nIt has been decided by the Government of India\nto  impound your above passport under\nsection\n10(3) (c)\nof the Passport Act, 1967 in  public\ninterest.\nYou  are\thereby required\t to  surrender\tyour\npassport K-869668 to this office within  seven\ndays  from  the date of the  receipt  of\tthis\nletter.\"\nOn  July  5, 1977 the petitioner addressed a letter  to\t the\nsecond\trespondent, Regional Transport\tOfficer,  requesting\nhim  to furnish her a copy of the statement of\tthe  reasons\nfor  making  the  impugned  order.   On\t July  7,  1977\t the\npetitioner  received  the following communication  from\t the\nMinistry of External Affairs:\n\"The  Government has decided to  impound\tyour\npassport\tin  the interest of  general  public\nunder\nsection 10(3)(c)\nof the  Passport\tAct,\n1967.   It  has further been  decided  by\t the\nGovernment  in the interest of general  public\nnot  to  furnish you a copy  of  statement  of\nreasons for making such orders as provided for\nunder\nsection  10(5)\nof\tthe  Passports\tAct,\n1967.\"\nThe   petitioner  submitted  that  the\torder\tis   without\njurisdiction  and not 'in the interests of general  public.'\nThe validity of the order was challenged on various grounds.\nIt was submitted that there was contravention of\nArt. 14\nof\nthe  Constitution, that principles of natural  justice\twere\nviolated;  that\t no  opportunity of hearing  as\t implied  in\nsection 10(3)\nof the Act was given and that the with-holding\nof  the\t reasons for the order under\nsection  10(5)\nis\t not\njustified  in law On July 8, 1977 the petitioner prayed\t for\nan  exparte  ad interim order staying the operation  of\t the\norder  of the respondents dated July 2, 1977 and for  making\nthe  order of stay absolute after hearing  the\trespondents.\nOn  behalf of the Union of India, Shri N. K. Ghose,  I.F.S.,\nDirector  (P.V.)  Ministry  of\tExternal  Affairs,  filed  a\ncounter\t affidavit.  It was stated in the counter  affidavit\nthat  on  May  11, 1977, the Minister  of  External  Affairs\napproved the impounding of the passport of 11 persons and on\nMay 19, 1977 an order was passed by the Minister  impounding\nthe passports of 8 persons out of 11 persons that on July 1,\n1977 the authorities concerned informed the Ministry of- Ex-\nternal\tAffairs\t that  the petitioner and  her\thusband\t had\narrived at Bombay on the after-noon of July 1, 1977 and that\ninformation  bad been received that there was likelihood  of\nthe   petitioner  leaving  the\tcountry.   The\t authorities\ncontacted the Ministry of External Affairs\n737\nand  Minister  after  going  through  the  relevant   papers\napproved the impounding of the passport of the petitioner on\nthe  evening  of July 1, 1977 in the  interests\t of  general\npublic\tunder\nSection 10(3)(c)\nof the Passports\t Act,  1967.\nOn  July 2, 1977 Regional Transport Officer on\tinstructions\nfrom the Government of India informed the- petitioner  about\nthe Central Government's decision to impound her passport in\npublic interest and requested her to surrender her passport.\nIn  the\t counter affidavit various allegations made  in\t the\npetition  were denied and it was stated that the  order\t was\nperfectly justified and that the petition is without  merits\nand should be dismissed.  The rejoinder affidavit was. filed\nby the petitioner on July 16, 1977.\nAn  application Civil Misc.  Petition No. 6210 of  1977\t was\nfiled by the petitioner for leave to urge additional grounds\nin  support  of\t the writ petition and\ta  counter  to\tthis\napplication was filed on behalf of the Ministry of  External\nAffairs on August 18, 1977.\nA petition by Adil Shahryar was filed seeking permission  to\nintervene  ill the writ petition and it was ordered by\tthis\nCourt.\tDuring the hearing of the writ petition,  Government\nproduced the order disclosing the reasons for impounding the\npassport. The reasons given are that it was apprehended that\nthe  petitioner was attempting or was likely to\t attempt  to\nleave the country and thereby hamper the functioning of\t the\nCommissions  of Inquiry.  According to the  Government,\t the\npetitioner  being the wife of Shri Sanjay Gandhi, there\t was\nlikelihood of the petitioner being questioned regarding some\naspects of the Commission.  In the counter affidavit it\t was\nfurther--alleged that there was good deal of evidence abroad\nand it would be unrealistic to over-look the possibility  of\ntampering   with  it  or  making  it  unavailable   to\t the\nCommission,  which can be done more easily  and\t effectively\nwhen  an  interested  person is 'abroad.   So  far  as\tthis\nallegation was concerned as it was not taken into account in\npassing the order it was given up during the hearing of\t the\nwrit  petition.\t The only ground on which  the\tpetitioner's\npassport  was  impounding  was that she\t was  likely  to  be\nexamined  by the Commission of Inquiry and her presence\t was\nnecessary in India.\nSeveral questions of law were raised.  It was submitted that\nthe  petitioner was a journalist by profession and that\t she\nintended  to proceed to West Germany in connection with\t her\nprofessional duties, as a journalist and that by denying her\nthe passport not only was her right to travel abroad  denied\nbut  her fundamental rights guaranteed under\nArticle  19(1)\nwere  infringed.   The contention was that before  an  order\npassed under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution could be  valid,\nit should not only satisfy the requirements of that article,\nnamely\tthat the order should be according to the  procedure\nestablished by law, but also should not in any way  infringe\non  her fundamental rights guaranteed under\nArticle  19(1).\nIn  other  words,  the\tsubmission was\tthat  the  right  to\npersonal  liberty cannot be deprived without satisfying\t the\nrequirements  of not only\nArt. 21\n, but also\nArticle 19.\nIn\naddition the provisions of\nSection 10(3)(c)\nwere  challenged\n'as  being ultra vires of the powers of the legislature\t and\nthat in any event\n738\nthe  order vitiated by the petitioner not having been  given\nan opportunity of being heard before the impugned order\t was\npassed.\t  It  was  contended  that  the\t fundamental  rights\nguaranteed  under\nArticle 19(1)\nparticularly the  right  of\nfreedom\t of speech and the right to practise profession\t was\navailable  to Indian citizens not only within the  territory\nof  India  but,\t also beyond the  Indian  territory  and  by\npreventing  the petitioner from travelling abroad her  right\nto  freedom  of\t speech and  right  to\tpractise  profession\noutside\t the country were also infringed. The plea  is\tthat\nthe  fundamental  rights  guaranteed under\narticle  19\nare\navailable not only within territory of India but outside the\nterritory of India as well.\nThe  question that arises for consideration is\twhether\t the\nFundamental   Rights,\tconferred   under   Part   III\t and\nparticularly  the  rights  conferred under\nArticle  19\nare\navailable   beyond  the\t territory  of\tIndia.\tthe   rights\nconferred  under Article 19 (1) (a), (b), (c), (f ) and\t (g)\nare\n(a)   to freedom of speech and expression;\n(b)   to assemble peacebly and without arms;\n(c)   to form associations or unions;\nx\t\t\t     x\t\t\t   x\nx\n(f)   to\t acquire,   hold  and\tdispose\t  of\nproperty; and\n(g)  to practise any profession, or to  carry\non any occupation, trade or business;\nThe  rights conferred under\nArticle 19(1) (d)\nand (e)  being\nlimited\t in  its  operation to the territory  of  India\t the\nquestion  of  their extraterritorial  application  does\t not\narise.\nIn order to decide this question, I may consider the various\nprovisions  of the Constitution, which throw some  light  on\nthis point.  The preamble to the Constitution provides\tthat\nthe  people, of India have solemnly resolved  to  constitute\nIndia\tinto  a\t Sovereign  Socialist  Secular\t Democrative\nRepublic and to secure to all its ciitzens:\nJustice, social,\teconomic and political;\nLiberty  of thought, expression, belief  faith\nand worship;\nEquality of status and of opportunity; and  to\npromote among them all,.\nFraternity assuring the, dignity of the individual and\tthe,\nunity of the nation.\nBy  the\t article,  India  is  constituted  as  a  Democratic\nrepublic and its citizens secured certain rights.  While-  a\nreading of the article would indicate that the articles\t are\napplicable  within  the\t territory of  India,  the  question\narises\twhether\t they are available beyond  the\t territorial\nlimits of India.\nArticle\t 12\nof\t the Constitution  defines  \"the  State\"  as\nincluding  the\tGovernment and Parliament of India  and\t the\nGovernment  and the Legislature of each of the\tStates\tand\nall local or other authorities within the territory of India\nor under the control of the Government\n739\nof   India.\nArticle  13\nprovides  that  laws\t  that\t are\ninconsistent with or in derogation of Fundamental Rights are\nto that extent void.\nArticle 13(1)\nprovides, that all\tlaws\nin  force in the territory of India immediately\t before\t the\ncommencement  of  this Constitution, in so far as  they\t are\ninconsistent  with the provisions of Part III shall, to\t the\nextent of such inconsistency, be void.\tWhat are the laws in\nforce  in the territory of India  immediately  before  the\ncommencement  ,of the Constitution that are referred  to  in\nthe  Article  will  have to be\tlooked\tinto.\tBefore\tthat\nArticle\t 13(2)\nmay be noticed which provides that the  State\nshall  not  make 'any law which takes away or  abridges\t the\nrights.\t conferred  by Part III, and any law  made  in\tcon-\ntravention  of\tthis  clause shall, to\tthe  extent  of\t the\ncontravention,\tbe void.  The word \"law\" in the\t Article  is\ndefined as:\n(a)   \"law\"  includes  any  Ordinance,  order,\nbye-law,\t rule,\t regulation,   notification,\ncustom  or  usage having in the  territory  of\nIndia the force of law; and\n(b)   \"laws in force\" includes laws passed  or\nmade  by\ta  Legislature\tor  other  competent\nauthority in the territory of India before the\ncommencement  of\tthis  Constitution  and\t not\npreviously repealed, notwithstanding that\t any\nsuch  law or any part thereof may not be\tthen\nin  operation either at all or  in  particular\nareas.\nWhile\tthe  applicability  of\tthe  custom  and  usage\t  is\nrestricted  to\tthe  territory of India \"law\"  may  have  an\nextra-territorial application.\nIn distributing the legislative powers between the Union and\nthe  'States\nArticle 248\nprovides that Parliament  may\tmake\nlaws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and\nthe  Legislature of a 'State may make laws for the whole  or\nany part of the State.\nArticle 245(2)\nprovides that no\t law\nmade  by  parliament shall be deemed to be  invalid  on\t the\nground that it would have extra-territorial operation.\tThis\narticle\t makes\tit clear that a State law  cannot  have\t any\nextra-territorial operation while that of the parliament can\nhave.\tThe  Parliament\t has undoubted power  to  enact\t law\nhaving extra-territorial application.  In England\nsection  3\nof  the\t Statute  of  Westminster,  1931  (22  Geo.   V.C.4)\nprovides :\n\"It  is hereby declared and enacted  that\t the\nParliament  of  a Dominion has full  power  to\nmake laws having extraterritorial operation.\"\nBut in determining whether the provisions of a\tConstitution\nor  a  ,statute have extra-territorial\tapplication  certain\nprinciples are laid down.  Maxwell on The Interpretation  of\nStatutes Twelfth Edition, at p. 169, while dealing with\t the\nterritorial application of British legislation has stated :-\n\"It has been said by the Judicial Committee of\nthe  Privy  Council  that :  '\nAn\tAct\nof\t the\nImperial Parliament today, unless it provides,\notherwise, applies to the whole of the United\nKingdom and to nothing outside the United\n740\nKingdom not even to the Channel Islands or the\nIsle  of Man, let alone to a  remote  overseas\ncolony of possession.\"\nLord  Denning M. R. has said that the general rule is  \"that\nan Act of Parliament only applies to transactions within the\nUnited\tKingdom and not to transactions outside.\" These\t two\nextracts  are from two decisions (1) Att.  Gen. for  Alberta\nvs.  Huggard Assets, Ltd., (1953) A.C. 420 and C.E.B. Draper\n&  Son,\t Ltd. vs.  Edward Turner & Son. Ltd. (1964)  3\tAll.\nE.R.  148 at p. 150 Maxwell comments on the  above  passages\nthus  \"These statements, however, perhaps  oversimplify\t the\nposition.\"  The decisions cited will be referred to in\tdue\ncourse.\nCraies\ton  Statute Law (Sixth Ed.) at p.  447\tstates\tthat\nan  Act\t of the legislature will bind the subjects  of\tthis\nrealm,\tboth within the kingdom and without, if such is\t its\nintention.   But  whether any particular Act  of  parliament\npurports to bind British subjects abroad will always  depend\nupon the intention of the legislature which must be gathered\nfrom  the  language of the Act in question.\"  Dicey  in\t his\nIntroduction  to  the Study of the Law of  the\tConstitution\n(1964\tEd.)  at  page\tlin  states  the  position  thus   :\n\"Parliament normally restricts the operation of\t legislation\nto  its own territories, British ships wherever they may  be\nbeing included in the ambit of territory.-Parliament does on\noccasions,   however,  pass  legislation   controlling\t the\nactivities of its own citizen when they are abroad.\" Salmond\nin  his\t book on Jurisprudence (Twelfth\t Ed.)  distinguishes\nbetween\t  the  territorial  enforcement\t of  law   and\t the\nterritoriality of law itself.  At p. 11 the author states :\n\"Since\tterritoriality is not a logically necessary part  of\nthe idea of law, a system of law is readily conceivable\t the\napplication  of\t which\tis limited  and\t determined  not  by\nreference to territorial considerations, but by reference to\nthe  personal  qualifications of the individuals  over\twhom\njurisdiction  is  exercised.\" According\t to  the  text-books\nabove  referred to, the position is that a law\tis  normally\napplicable within the territory, but can be made  applicable\nto  its citizens wherever they may be.\tWhether such  extra-\nterritorial applicability is intended or not will have to be\nlooked for in the legislation.\nI will now refer to the decisions of courts an this subject.\nIn Niboyet v. Niboyet(1) the Court of Appeal stated: \"It  is\ntrue that the words of the statute are general, but  general\nword,,, in a statute have never, so far as I am aware,\tbeen\ninterpreted so as to extend the action of the statute beyond\nthe territorial authority of the Legislature.  All  criminal\nstatutes are in their terms general; but they apply only  to\noffences  committed  within  the  territory  or\t by  British\nsubjects.  When the Legislature intends the statute to apply\nbeyond the ordinary territorial authority of the country, it\nso  states  expressly  in the statute  as  in  the  Merchant\nShippina  Acts, and in some of the Admiralty Acts.\"  In\t the\nQueen  v.   Jameson and Others (2)  the Chief  Justice\tLord\nRusset\n(1)  48 L. J. P. I at p. 10.\n(2)  [1896] 2 Q. B. Division 425 at 430.\n741\nstated\tthe position thus : \"It may be said  generally\tthat\nthe  area  within. which a statute is to  operate,  and\t the\npersons\t against whom it is to operate, are to\tbe  gathered\nfrom the language and purview of the particular statute.  In\nCooke  v.  The Charles A. Vogeler Company(1), the  House  of\nLords  in  dealing  with the jurisdiction of  the  Court  of\nBankruptcy  observed that \"English legislation is  primarily\nterritorial,  and it is no departure from that principle  to\nsay  that  a foreigner coming to this  country\tand  trading\nhere,  and here committing an act of bankruptcy, is  subject\nto our laws and to, all the incidents which those laws enact\nin such a case; while he is here, while he is trading,\teven\nif  not actually domiciled, he is liable to be made a  bank-\nrupt  like  a native citizen........ It is  limited  in\t its\nterms  to  England; and I think it would  be  impossible  to\nsuppose\t that  if the Legislature had intended\tso  broad  a\njurisdiction  as is contended for here,, it would  not\thave\nconferred it by express enactment.\" In Tomalin v. S. Pearson\n&  Son,\t Limited(2)  the Court of appeal  dealing  with\t the\napplication of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906,  quoted\nwith  approval a passage from Maxwell on  Interpretation  of\nStatutes  at p. 213 where in it was stated: \"In the  absence\nof an intention clearly expressed or to be inferred from its\nlanguage, or from the object or subject-matter or history of\nthe  enactment, the presumption is that Parliament does\t not\ndesign its statutes to operate beyond the territorial limits\nof  the United Kingdom\".  The law that is applicable in\t the\nUnited\tKingdom\t is fairly summed up in the  above  passage.\nThe  presumption  is  that the statute is  not\tintended  to\noperate\t beyond\t the territorial limits\t unless\t a  contrary\nintention  is  expressed  or  could  be\t inferred  from\t its\nlanguage.   The decision of the Privy Council  in  Att.-Gen.\nfor  Alberta v. Huggard Assets, Ltd. (8), has  already\tbeen\nreferred to as a quotation from Maxwell's Interpretation  of\nStatutes.  The Privy Council in that case held that \"\nAn\t Act\nof   the  Imperial  Parliament\ttoday  unless  it   provides\notherwise, applies to the whole of the United Kingdom and to\nnothing outside the 'United Kingdom: not even to the Channel\nIslands\t or the Isle of Man, let alone to a remote  overseas\ncolony\tor  possession.\"  The Court of\tAppeal\tin  a  later\ndecision  reported  in (1964) 3 All.  E.R.  p.\t148  (C.E.B.\nDraper & Son, Ltd. vs.\tEdward Turner & Son, Ltd.)  approved\nof  the proposition laid down in Att.  Gen. for Alberta\t vs.\nHuggard\t Assets, Ltd., observing \"Prima facie an Act of\t the\nUnited\tKingdom\t Parliament, unless it\tprovides  otherwise,\napplies\t to the whole of the United Kingdom and\t to  nothing\noutside the United Kingdom\".\nThe cases decided by the Federal Court and the Supreme Court\nof  India  may be taken note of.  Dealing  with\t the  extra-\nterritorial application of the provisions of the\nIncome-tax\nAct\n,  the Federal Court in Governor--General in\t Council  v.\nRaleigh Investment Co. Ltd. (4) after finding that there was\nno  territorial operation of the Act observed that if  there\nwas  any  extra\t territorial  operation\t it  is\t within\t the\nlegislative  powers given to tile Indian Legislature by\t the\nConstitution  Act\n.   After discussing the case-law  'on\t the\nsubject at p. 61 regarding the making of laws for the\n(1)  [1901] A. C. 102 at p. 107.\n(2)  [1909] 2 K. B. 61.\n(3)  [1953] A. C. 420.\n(4)  A. I. R. (31) 1944 Federal Court 51.\n9-119 SCI/78\n742\nwhole or any part of British India on topics in Lists I\t and\nIII  of\t Sch. 7 and holding that the  Federal  Legislature's\npowers\tfor extra-territorial legislation is not limited  to\nthe cases specified in clauses (a) to (e) of sub-section (2)\nof\nsection  99\nof  the  Government  of  India\t Act,  1935,\nconcluded  by  stating that the extent, if  any,  of  extra-\nterritorial  operation which is to be found in the  impugned\nprovisions  is\twithin the legislative powers given  to\t the\nIndian\tLegislature  by\t the\nConstitution  Act\n.   Again  in\nWallace\t Brothers & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of\t Income-tax,\nBombay,\t Sind  and Baluchistan\n(1),- the Federal\t Court\theld\nthat  there  was no element of\textraterritoriality  in\t the\nimpugned  provisions of the\nIndian Income-tax Act\n, and\teven\nif  the provisions were in any measure\textraterritorial  in\ntheir  effect, that was not a ground for holding them to  be\nultra vires the Indian Legislature.\nIn\nMohammad Mohy-ud-din\nv.  The King Emperor\n(2), the Federal Court  was\t considering\nthe  validity of the Indian Army Act, 191 1. In this case  a\nperson\twho  was not a British subject but had\taccepted,  a\ncommission  in the Indian Army was arraigned before a  court\nmartial\t for  trial  for  offences  alleged  to\t have\tbeen\ncommitted  by him outside British India.  It was  held\tthat\nsection\t 41  of\t the  Indian  Army  Act,  191  1,  conferred\njurisdiction on the courtmartial to try non-British subjects\nfor  offences committed by them beyond British India.  On  a\nconstruction  of\nsection 43\nof the Act the Court  held\tthat\nthe  court-martial has powers \"over all the native  officers\nand  soldiers  in  the said  military  service\tto  whatever\nPresidency   such  officers  and  soldiers  may\t belong\t  or\nwheresoever  they may be serving.\"\nRepelling the  contention\nthat there was a presumption against construing even general\nwords  in  an Act of Parliament as intended to\thave  extra-\nterritorial   effect   or   authorising\t   extra-territorial\nlegislation  the Court observed: \"The passages relied on  in\nthis connection from Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutes do\nnot go the length necessary for the appeIlant's case.  It is\ntrue that every statute is to be interpreted, so far as\t its\nlanguage  admits, as not to be inconsistent with the  comity\nof  nations or with the established rules  of  International\nLaw.   Whatever\t may  be the rule of  International  Law  as\nregards\t the ordinary citizen, we have not been referred  to\nany rule of International Law or principle of the comity  of\nnations\t which is inconsistent with a State exercising\tdis-\nciplinary  control  over its own armed\tforces,\t when  those\nforces\tare operating outside its territorial limits\".\t The\nlaw  as\t laid  down by the Courts  may\tnow  be\t summarised.\nParliament   normally\trestricts  the\toperation   of\t the\nlegislation  to\t its own territories.  Parliament  may\tpass\nlegislation  controlling  the  activities  of  the  citizens abroad.   An\nintention to have extra territorial  operation\nshould be expressed or necessarily implied from the language\nof the Statute.\t The Statute should be so interpreted as not\nto  be inconsistent with the comity of nations or  with\t the\nestablished rules of international law.\nIt is now necessary to examine the various articles of\tPart\nIII of the Constitution to find out whether any intention is\nexpressed  to  make  any  of  the  rights  available  extra-\nterritorially.\t The application of\nArticle 14\nis  expressly\nlimited to the territory of India as, it lays down that \"The\n(1)  [1945] F.C.R. 65.\n(2)  [1946] F.C.R. 94.\n743\nState  shall not deny to any person equality before the\t law\nor the equal protection of the laws within the territory  of\nIndia\".\nArticle 15\nrelates to prohibition of discrimination\non grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of  birth,\nand\nArt. 16\ndeals with equality of opportunity in matters of\npublic\temployment.  By their very nature the  two  Articles\nare confined to the territory of India.\t So also\nArticles 17\nand\n18\nwhich deal with abolition  of\tuntouchability\tand\nabolition of titles.  Before dealing with\nArticles 19\nand\n21\nwith  which we are now concerned the  other articles may  be\nreferred  to  in brief.\nArticles 20\nand\n22\ncan  have\tonly\nterritorial application.\nArticles 23\nand\n24\nwhich relate to\nright  against\texploitation  and\nArticles 25\nto  28  which\nrelate\tto  freedom  of\t conscience  and  free\t profession,\npractice  and propagation of religion etc. prima  focie\t are\napplicable only to the territory of India At any rate  there\nis   no\t intention  in\tthese  Articles\t indicating   extra-\nterritorial  application.  So also\narticles 29\nand\n30\nwhich\ndeal  with  cultural and educational rights  are  applicable\nonly  within  the territory of India.\nArticle 31\ndoes\t not\nexpressly  or  impliedly have any extra\t territorial  appli-\ncation.\t  In  this background it will have  to\tbe  examined\nwhether\t  any  express\tor  implied  intention\t of   extra-\nterritorial applicability is discernible in Articles 19\t and\n21.\nArticle\t 19(1) (a)\ndeclares the right to freedom  of  speech\nand  expression.  While it is possible that this  right\t may\nhave  extra-territorial application, it is not\tlikely\tthat\nthe  framers  of  the Constitution  intended  the  right  to\nassemble peaceably and without arms or to form\tassociations\nor unions, or to acquire hold and dispose of property, or to\npractise  any  profession, or to carry\ton  any\t occupation,\ntrade\tor   business,\tto  have   any\t extra\t territorial\napplication,  for such rights could not be enforced  by\t the\nState  outside the Indian territory.  The  rights  conferred\nunder\nArt. 19\nare Fundamental Rights and\nArticles 32\nand\n226\nprovide that these rights are guaranteed and can be enforced\nby the aggrieved person by approaching the Supreme Court  or\nthe High Courts.  Admittedly, the rights enumerated in\nArt.\n19(1)  (a)\n, (b), (c), (f) and (g) cannot be enforced by\t the\nState  and in the circumstances there is a presumption\tthat\nthe Constitution-makers would have intended to guarantee any\nright  which the State cannot enforce and would have made  a\nprovision  guaranteeing\t the  rights and  securing  them  by\nrecourse to the Supreme Court and the High Courts.\nThe restriction of the right to move freely throughout\t the\nterritory  of India and the right to reside and stay in\t any\npart  of the territory of India is strongly relied  upon  as\nindicating  that  in the absence of  such  restrictions\t the\nother  rights are not confined to the, territory  of  India.\nThe provisions in\nArt. 19 (1) (d)\nand (e) i.e. the right  to\nmove freely throughout the territory of India and to  reside\nand  settle  in\t any part of the  territory  of\t India\thave\nhistorical significance.\nIn\nA. K. Gopalan vs.\tThe State of\nMadras\n,(1)  Kania  C.J.,  said that in the  right  \"to\tmove\nfreely\tthroughout the territory of India\" the emphasis\t was\nnot  on\t the free movement but on the right to\tmove  freely\nthroughout  the\t territory of India.  The intention  was  to\navoid  any restriction being placed by the States  hampering\nfree movement\n(1)  [1950] S.C.R. 88.\n744\nthroughout the territory of India.  It is a historical\tfact\nthat there were rivalries between the various States and the\nimposition  of restraint on movement from State to State  by\nsome States was not beyond possibility.\t In the two  clauses\n19 (1) (d) and (e) the right \"to move freely throughout\t the\nterritory of India\" and \"to reside and settle in any part of\nthe  territory\tof  India\"  the\t \"territory  of\t India\"\t  is\nmentioned  with\t the purpose of preventing the\tStates\tfrom\nimposing  any  restraint.   From the  fact  that  the  words\n\"territory  of\tIndia\" are found in these  two\tclauses\t the\ncontention  that the other freedoms are not limited  to\t the\nterritory  of India for their operation cannot be  accepted.\nIn\nVirendra v. The  State  of Punjab and Another\n,(1)  S.  R.\nDas, C. J., who spoke on behalf\t of the\t Constitution  Bench\nstated : \"The point to, be kept in view\t  is  that   several\nrights\tof  freedom guaranteed to the  citizens\t by\nArticle\n19(1)\nare exercisable by them throughout and in all parts of\nthe  territory\tof India\".  The view that the  rights  under\nArt. 19 (1)\nis exercisable in the territory of India has not\nbeen   discussed.   Far\t from\nArt.  19(1)\nexpressing\t any\nintention  expressly  or  impliedly  of\t extra\t territorial\noperation the context would indicate that its application is\nintended to be only territorial.  The right under\nArt. 19(b)\nand  (c) to assemble peaceably and without arms and to\tform\nassociations or unions could not have been intended to\thave\nany  extraterritorial  application  as it  will\t not  be  in\naccordance  with  the accepted principles  of  international\nlaw.   As the rights under\nArticles 19(b)\nand (c) cannot  be\nenforced  outside  India the inference, is  that  no  extra-\nterritorial application was intended.  So also regarding the\nrights\tconferred  under\nArticles 19(f)\nand  (g)  i.e.  to\nacquire,  hold and dispose of property; and to practise\t any\nprofession,  or\t to  carry  on\tany  occupation,  trade\t  or\nbusiness,  would  not have been intended  to  be  applicable\noutside India.\nIt  was submitted that when the Constitution was framed\t the\nfounding  fathers  were influenced by  the  United  Nations'\nUniversal  Declaration\tof Human Rights which  was  made  in\nDecember,  1948\t and  they  thought  it\t fit  to  make\t the\nFundamental   Rights  available\t to  the   Indian   citizens\nthroughout the world.  The history of the conception of\t hu-\nman  rights  may be shortly traced.  The main  task  of\t the\nHuman  Rights'\tCommission which was set up  by\t the  United\nNations\t was to draw an International Bill of  Rights.\t The\nCommission  split  this task into two documents\t :  a  short\ndeclaration  of\t principles  and  an  elaborate\t treaty\t  or\ncovenant  enforcing those principles so far as\tpracticable.\nThe  Universal Declaration of Human Rights was not  intended\nto be binding as law but to present the main ideals of human\nrights\tand freedoms in order to inspire everybody,  whether\nin  or\tout of governments, to work  for  their\t progressive\nrealization.  The Commission finished the Declaration and it\nwas  promulgated  by the UN Assembly on December  10,  1948.\nThe  discussion\t about the Draft  Indian  Constitution\ttook\nplace  between February and October, 1948 and  the  Articles\nrelating  to  the  Fundamental\tRights\twere  discussed\t  in\nOctober,  1948,\t i.e. before the  Universal  Declaration  of\nHuman Rights was promulgated by the UN Assembly on  December\n10,  1948.  It is most unlikely that before the\t Declaration\nof Human Rights was promulgated '\n(1) [1958]S.C.R.308.\n745\nthe  framers of the Indian Constitution decided\t to  declare\nthat the Fundamental Rights conferred on the citizens  would\nhave   application  even  outside  India.    The   Universal\nDeclaration  of Human Rights was not binding as law but\t was\nonly  a pious hope for achieving a common standard  for\t all\npeoples\t and  all nations.\nArticle 13\nof  the\t Declaration\nwhich is material for our discussion runs as follows :\nParagraph  1. Everyone has the right to freedom of  movement\nand residence with in the borders of each state.\nParagraph  2. Everyone has the right to leave  any  country,\nincluding his own, and to return to his country.\nParagraph  1 restricts the right of movement  and  residence\nspecifically within the borders of the country.\t The second,\nparagraph  aims at securing the right to leave\tany  country\nincluding  his\town  and  to return  to\t his  country.\t The\nDeclaration  at\t that  stage  did  not\thave  any  idea\t  of\nconferring on the citizens of any country right of  movement\nbeyond borders of the State or to freedom of speech or right\nto  assemble  outside the country of origin.   Even  in\t the\nAmerican  Constitution\tthere  is no  mention  of  right  to\nfreedom\t of speech or expression as being available  outside\nAmerica.  Regarding the right of movement within the borders\nof  the\t State it is not mentioned as one  of  the  freedoms\nguaranteed in the American Constitution but everyone in\t the\ncountry\t takes\tit  for granted that one can  roam  at\twill\nthroughout the United States.\nThe right of a citizen to leave any country and to return to\nhis country is recognised in the United States.\t While there\nis  no\trestriction  on the citizen to\treturn\tto  his\t own\ncountry\t the  Government  of the United\t States\t does  place\ncertain\t restrictions  for  leaving  the  country,  such  as\nobtaining  of the passports etc.  Even the right  to  travel\noutside\t the United States is not unrestricted.\t A  passport\nis a request by the Government which grants it to a  foreign\nGovernment  that the bearer of the passport may pass  safely\nand  freely.   The passport is considered as a\tlicence\t for\nleaving a country and an exit permit rather than a letter of\nintroduction.  Even in America the State Department when  it\nissues\ta  passport specifies that they are  not  valid\t for\ntravel\tto  countries  in-which the United  States  have  no\ndiplomatic representation as the position of the  Government\nis  that it will not facilitate overseas travel where it  is\nunable\tto  afford  any protection to  the  traveller.\t The\nAmerican public particularly the news reporters are claiming\nthat they should be allowed to travel wherever they wish  if\nneed be without their Government's assurance to\t protection.\n'The  right  of\t the American citizen to  travel  abroad  as\nnarrated  above shows that even the right to travel  outside\nthe country is not unfettered.\nIn  vain one looks to the American law to find\twhether\t the\ncitizens  are  granted any right of freedom  of\t speech\t and\nexpression  beyond the territory of the United States.\t The\nFirst  Amendment  provides for freedom of speech  and  press\nalong  with  freedom  of religion.  Liberty  of\t speech\t and\nliberty\t of  press are substantially  identical.   They\t are\nfreedom\t to utter words orally and freedom to  write,  print\nand  circulate words.  But this freedom of expression  would\nbe  meaningless\t if people were not permitted to  gather  in\ngroups to discuss mutual\n746\nproblems and communicate their feelings and opinions to\ngovernmental   officers.   The\tFirst  Amendment   therefore\nprovides  that\tthe  people  have  the\tright  to   assemble\npeaceably  and\tpetition  the  government  for\tredress\t  of\ngrievances.  The- petition for redress can only be  confined\nto  the\t United States of America.  In a recent\t address  on\nHuman  Rights Warren Christopher, U.S. Deputy  Secretary  of\nState  reproduced in Shan, October 1977, stated\t before\t the\nAmerican  Bar Association in Chicago that the  promotion  of\nhuman  rights has become a fundamental tenet of the  foreign\npolicy\tof  the Carter Administration.\t In  explaining\t the\nconception  of human rights and its practice in America\t the\nDeputy Secretary stated that the efforts should be  directed\nto  the most fundamental and important human rights  all  of\nwhich  are  internationally  recognised\t in  the   Universal\nDeclaration  of\t Human\tRights\twhich  the  United   Nations\napproved  in 1948.  While emphasing the three categories  of\nhuman rights (1) the right to be free from the\tgovernmental\nviolation of the integrity of the person; (2)- the right  to\nfulfilment of such vital needs as food, shelter, health care\nand  education,\t and  (3)  the\tright  to  enjoy  civil\t and\npolitical liberties, he stated that the freedom of  thought,\nof  religion, of assembly, of speech, of the press,  freedom\nof movement within the outside one's own country; freedom to\ntake part in government, were liberties which\t  American\nenjoy  so fully, and too often take for granted,  are  under\nassault in many places.\t It may be noted that while freedom\nof movement is referred to as both within and outside  one's\nown  country  the other rights such as freedom\tthought,  of\nreligion, of assembly of speech, of press, are not stated to\nbe  available  outside one's own country.  It is  thus\tseen\nthat except the right to movement outside    one's\t own\ncountry\t other rights are not available\t extra-territorially\neven in America.\nThe fundamental rights, under\nArt. 19(1)\nof the Constitution\nare  subject  to the restrictions that may be  placed  under\nArt.  19(2)\nto (6) of the  Constitution.   The\t Fundamental\nRights\tare  not  absolute but\tare  subject  to  reasonable\nrestrictions  Provided for in the Constitution itself.\t The\nrestrictions imposed are to be by operation of any  existing\nlaw  or\t making\t of  a\tlaw  by\t the  Legislature   imposing\nreasonable restrictions.  The scheme of the Article, thus it\nwhile  conferring Fundamental Rights on the citizens  is  to\nsee  that such exercise does not affect the rights of  other\npersons\t or  affect the society in general.   The  law\tmade\nunder\nArt. 19(2)\nto (6), impose restrictions on the exercise\nof  right of freedom of speech and expression,\tto  assemble\npeaceably without arms etc.  The restrictions thus  imposed,\nnormally  would\t apply only within the\tterritory  of  India\nunless\t the   legislation  expressly\tor   by necessary\nimplication  provides for extra-territorial  operation.\t  In\nthe  Penal  Code, under\nsections 3\nand\n4\n, the  Act  is\tmade\nspecifically applicable to crimes that are committed outside\nIndia  by  citizen  of India.  Neither in\nArt.\t 19\nof\t the\nConstitution  nor in any of the enactments  restricting\t the\nrights under\nArt. 19(2)\nis there any provision expressly  or\nby  necessary  implication providing  for  extra-territorial\napplication.   A  citizen  cannot  enforce  his\t Fundamental\nRights\toutside the territory of India even if it  is  taken\nthat such rights are available outside the country.\n747\nIn  the\t view  that  a\tcitizen\t is  not  entitled  to\t the\nFundamental  Rights  guaranteed under\nArt.  19\noutside\t the\nterritorial limits of India,- the contention of the  learned\ncounsel for the petition that by denying him the passport to\ntravel outside India, his Fundamental Rights like freedom of\nspeech\tand expression, to assemble peaceably,\tto  practise\nprofession or to carry on occupation, trade or business\t are\ninfringed,   cannot  be\t accepted.   The  passport  of\t the\npetitioner was impounded on the ground that her presence  in\nconnection with the Inquiry Commission may be necessary\t and\nin  the interest of public it was necessary to do  so.\t The\nimpugned  order\t does  not place  any  restrictions  on\t the\npetitioner while she is away from India.  Hence the question\nwhether the State could impose such restraint does not arise\nin this case.  As the contention was that by impounding the,\npassport  the petitioner's fundamental right of\t freedom  of\nspeech\tetc.  outside the country was infringed,  it  became\nnecessary  to  consider\t whether the citizen  had  any\tsuch\nright.\nIt  was\t strenuously  contended\t that  the  Legislature\t  by\ninvolving   powers   under\nArt.  21\ncannot   deprive\t the\nFundamental  Rights  guaranteed under\nArt. 19\nat  any\trate\nwithin\tthe  territory of India.  It win now  be  considered\nwhether an Act passed under\nArt. 21\nshould also satisfy\t the\nrequirements of\nArt. 19.\nThe  submission was that Art. 19 applies to laws made  under\nArticles  20,  21  and 22 and the  citizen  is\tentitled  to\nchallenge  the validity of an Act made under Art. 21 on\t the\nground\tthat it affects the rights secured to him under\t cl.\n(1) of\nArt. 19.\nArticle 20(1)\nprovides that no person shall\nbe convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in\nforce at the time of the commission of the act charged as an\noffence,  nor  be subjected to a penalty greater  than\tthat\nwhich  might have been inflicted under the law in  force  at\nthe time of the commission of the offence.\nArticle 22\ndeals\nwith  protection  against arrest and  detention\t in  certain\ncases, that is, in respect of preventive detention.\nIt has been decided by this Court in Gopalan's(1) case; that\nin  the\t case of punitive detention for offences  under\t the\nPenal  Code, it cannot be challenged on the ground  that  it\ninfringes  the right specified under Art. 19(a) to  (e)\t and\n(g) of the Constitution of India.  Kania C.J. held :\n\"If there is a legislation directly attempting\nto  control a citizen's freedom of  speech  or\nexpression, or his right to assemble peaceably\nand  without arms etc.; the  question  whether\nthat,  legislation  is saved by  the  relevant\nsaving  clause  of\nArt. 19\nwill\tarise.\t If,\nhowever,\tthe, legisation is not\tdirectly  in\nrespect  of  any of these subjects, but  as  a\nresult of the operation of other\tlegislation,\nfor  instance,  for  punitive  or\t  preventive\ndetention,  his right under any of these\tsub-\nclauses  is  abridged  the  question  of\t the\napplication of\nArticle 19\ndoes not arise.\"\n(1) [1950] S.C.R. 88.\n748\nFazal  Ali  J., though he dissented from the  majority\tview\nregarding   the\t application  of\nArticle  19\nto   punitive\ndetention observed follows\n\"The\nIndian  Penal Code\ndoes  not  primarily\nor .... necessarily impose restrictions on the\nfreedom  of movement and it is not correct  to\nsay that it is a law imposing restrictions  on\nthe right to move freely.\t Its primary  object\nis  to  punish  crime  and  not  to   restrict\nmovement......  But  if  it  (the\t Punishment)\nconsists\t in   imprisonment   there   is\t   a\nrestriction  on movement.\t This  restraint  is\nimposed not under a law imposing\trestrictions\non movement but under a law defining crime and\nmaking  it  punishable.\tThe  punishment\t  is\ncorrelated directly With the violation of some\nother person's right and not with the right of\nmovement\tpossessed by the  offender  himself.\nIn  my  opinion, therefore, the\nIndian  Penal\nCode\ndoes  not come within the ambit  of\t the\nwords 'law' imposing restrictions on the right\nto move freely.\"\nThe learned Judge, Justice Fazal Ali, took a different\tview\nregarding preventive detention on the basis that it did\t not\nadmit  of  a trial but the order of detention rested  on  an\napprehended  and  not  actual  danger.\t Regarding  punitive\ndetention, the decision of a Bench of five Judges in H. Saha\nv. State of West Bengal,(1) expressed the same view.   Chief\nJustice Ray observed :\n\"It is not possible to think that a person who\nis  detained  will  yet be  free\tto  move  or\nassemble or form association or unions or have\nthe  right to reside in any part of  India  or\nhave  the\t freedom of  speech  or\t expression.\nSuppose, a person is prosecuted of an  offence\nof  cheating and convicted after trial, it  is\nnot  open to him to say that the\timprisonment\nshould be tested with reference to\nArt. 19\nfor\nits  reasonableness.   A\tlaw  which  attracts\nArticle  19\n,  therefore, must be\tsuch  as  is\ncapable of being tested to be reasonable under\nclauses (2) to (5) of\nArticle 19.\"\nIn  the case of punitive detention, it will be open  to\t the\naccused\t to raise all defences that are open to him in\tlaw,\nsuch  as  that there have been no violation of\tany  law  in\nforce.\tRegarding punitive detention this Court in\nSaha\ncase\nhas held that as the Constitution has conferred rights under\nArt. 19\nand also adopted the preventive detention to prevent\nthe greater evil by imperilling security, the safety of\t the\nState  and the welfare of the nation, it is not possible  to\nthink that a person who is detained will yet be free to move\nor assemble or form associations etc.\nApplying  the same reasoning, it is contended on  behalf  of\nthe  state  that when a person is deprived of  his  life  or\npersonal   liberty   in\t accordance   with   the   procedure\nestablished  by law, he cannot invoke to his aid any of\t the\nrights\tguaranteed  under\nArt. 19\nof  the  Constitution  of\nIndia.\tWhether this contention could be accepted\n(1) [1975] 1 S.C.R. 778.\n749\nor not will be examined with reference to the provisions  of\nthe Constitution and the decisions rendered by this Court.\nArticle 19\nto 22 appear under the title \"Right to  freedom\".\nArticle 19\nconfers freedoms on the citizens whereas Aft.  20\nto 22 are not limited to citizens but apply to all  persons.\nArticle\t 19\ndoes not deal with the right to life  which  is\ndealt  with  under\nArt. 21.\nWhile\nArt.  19\nprovides\t for\nfreedoms-which\ta citizen is entitled to,\nArticles 20\nto  22\nrestrain  the State from doing certain things.\t Though\t the\nright  to life and personal liberty is not dealt with  under\nArt. 19\n, as it is mentioned in\nArt. 21\nthough in a  negative\nform, the right to life and personal liberty is secured\t and\nthe  State  can deprive it only according to  the  procedure\nestablished by law.  While the rights guaranteed under\nArt.\n19(1)\nare  subject to restrictions that may  be  placed  by\nArticles 19 (2)\nto (6), the right not to be deprived of life\nand  personal liberty is subject to its deprivation by\tpro-\ncedure established by law.  The scope of the words \"personal\nliberty\"  was considered by Mukherjea, J. in Gopalan's\tcase\n(supra.)  The learned Judge observed : \"\nArticle 19\ngives  a\nlist  of individual liberties and prescribes in the  various\nclauses the restrictions that may be placed upon them by law\nso  that  they may not conflict with the public\t welfare  or\ngeneral morality.  On the other hand,\nArticles 20\n, 21\nand\n22\nare  primarily concerned with penal enactments or other\t law\nunder  which personal safety or liberty of persons would  be\ntaken  away in the interest of society and the set down\t the\nlimits\t within\t  which\t  the  State   control\t should\t  be\nexercised......\t the right to the safety of one's  life\t and\nlimbs' and to enjoyment of personal liberty, in the sense of\nfreedom\t from physical re-strain and coercion of  any  sort,\nare  the  inherent birth right-. of a man.  The\t essence  of\nthese rights consists in restraining others from interfering\nwith  them  and hence they cannot be described in  terms  of\n\"freedom\"  to  do  particular  things.\t.  .  .\"  The  words\n\"personal   liberty\"  take  their  colour  from\t the   words\n\"deprivation  of  rifle'.  It means liberty of\tthe  person,\nthat is freedom from personal restraint.\nArticle 21\nis\t one\nof  the\t Articles along with\nArticles 20\nand\n22\nwhich\tdeal\nwith restraint on the person.  According to Dicey :\n\"The  right to personal liberty as  understood\nin England means in substance a person's right\nnot to be subjected to imprisonment, arrest or\nother  physical  coercion in any\tmanner\tthat\ndoes not admit of legal justification.\"\n(Dicey's\tLaws of Constitution 10th Edn.\tpage\n207)\nIn the debates relating to the drafting of the Constitution,\nin\nArt.  15\nthe word that was\t used  was  \"liberty\".\t The\nframers of the Constitution thought that the word  \"liberty\"\nshould be qualified by the insertion of the word  \"personal\"\nbefore it for otherwise it might be construed very widely so\nas  to\tinclude even the freedoms already dealt\t with  under\nArt.   19\n,  30\t(which\tcorresponds  to\nArt.  19\nin\t the\nConstitution).\nThe word \"personal liberty\" in\nArticle  21\nis, therefore, confined to freedom from restraint of  person\nand is different from other rights enumerated in\nArticle  19\nof the Constitution.\n750\nIt  is contended on behalf of the petitioner that after\t the\ndecision  of  the\nBank\t Nationalisation\ncase\tand\nBennet\nColomon\n's  case the view taken earlier by the Supreme  Court\nthat  in  construing  whether the  deprivation\tof  personal\nliberty is valid or not the enquiry should only be  confined\nto  the\t validity of the procedure  prescribed\twithout\t any\nreference  to  the rights conferred under\nArt. 19(1)\nis  no\nlonger good law.  The decisions bearing on this question may\nnow be examined.\nIn\nGopalan\n's case it was held that\nArt. 19\ndealt  with\t the\nrights\tof the citizens when he was free, and did not  apply\nto  a person who had ceased to be free and had\tbeen  either\nunder  punitive or preventive legislation.  It\twas  further\nheld that\nArt. 19\nonly applied where a legislation  directly\nhit  the rights enumerated in the Article and not where\t the\nloss of rights mentioned in the Article was a result of\t the\noperation of legislation relating to punitive or  preventive\ndetention.   It was also stated by Justice Mukherjea that  a\nlaw depriving the personal liberty must be a valid law which\nthe  legislature is competent to enact within the limits  of\nthe powers assigned to it and which does not transgress\t any\nof the Fundamental Rights the Constitution lays dawn.  The,,\nlearned\t Judge\texplained that the reasonableness of  a\t law\ncoming under\nArt. 21\ncould not be questioned with  reference\nto anything in\nArt. 19\nthough a law made under\nArt. 21\nmust\nconform\t to  the  requirements of\nArticles 14\nand\n20.\nIt\ncannot be said that it should conform to the requirements of\nArticle\t 19.\nThe, view, thus expressed in\nGopalan\n's  case,\nwas  affirmed by the Supreme Court in\nRam Singh v. State  of\nDelhi\n(1) where it was held :\n\"Although\t personal  liberty  has\t a   content\nsufficiently  comprehensive  to  include\t the\nfreedoms\tenumerated  in\nArt. 19(1)\n,  and\t its\ndeprivation would result in the extinction  of\nthose  freedoms, the Constitution has  treated\nthese   civil  liberties\tas   distinct\tfrom\nfundamental    rights   and   made    separate\nprovisions  in\nArt. 19\nand Arts. 21 and 22  as\nto  the limitations and conditions subject  to\nwhich  alone  they  could\t be  taken  away  or\nabridged\t...  The  interpretation  of   these\nArticles and their correlation was elaborately\ndealt  with  by the full\tcourt  in  Gopalan's\ncase.\nApproving  the interpretation of the Articles  in  Gopalan's\ncase  it was held that law which authorises  deprivation  of\npersonal liberty did not fall within the purview of\nArt.  19\nand  its  validity  was not to be  judged  by  the  criteria\nindicated  in  that Article but depended on  its  compliance\nwith the requirements of Arts. 21 to 22.\nThis view was again affirmed in\nState of Bihar v.  Kameshwar\nSingh\n,(2)  where Das, J. in approving the law\nlaid  down  in\nGopalan\n's case observed as follows\n\"As I explained in\nGopalan\n's case and again in\nChiranjit\t  LaPs\t case  1950  SCR   869\t our\nConstitution  protects  the  freedom  of\t the\ncitizen by\narticle 19 (1) (a)\nto\n(1)  [1951] S.C.R. 451\n(2)  [1952] S.C.R 889.\n751\n(e)   and\t (g)  but empowers the\tState,\teven\nwhile   those   freedoms\t last,\t to   impose\nreasonable   restrictions\t on  them   in\t the\ninterest\tof the State or of public  order  or\nmorality or of the general public as mentioned\nin  clauses (2) to (6).  Further,\t the  moment\neven this regulated freedom of the  individual\nbecomes  incompatible with and  threatens\t the\nfreedom  of the community the State  is  given\npower by\narticle 21\n, to deprive the individual\nof his life and personal liberty in accordance\nwith procedure established by law, subject  of\ncourse, to the provisions of\nArt. 22.\nIn\nExpress  Newspapers (P) Ltd. & another v. The  Union  of\nIndia, & Others\n, (1) the test laid down was that there\tmust\nbe  a  direct  or inevitable  consequence  of  the  measures\nenacted\t in  the impugned Act, it would not be\tpossible  to\nstrike\tdown  the  legislation as  having  that\t effect\t and\noperation.   A possible eventuality of this type  would\t not\nnecessary   be\tthe  consequence  which\t could\tbe  in\t the\ncontemplation  of the legislature while enacting  a  measure\nof. this type for the benefit of the workmen concerned.\t The\ntest, thus applied, is whether the consequences were \"direct\nand inevitable\" ?\nIn\nHamdard Dawakhana (Wakf) Lal Kuan v. Union of  India\n,(2)\nafter citing with approval the case of\nRam Singh and Express\nNewspapers\ncase, it was observed :\n\"It is not the form or Incidental infringement\nthat  determine  the  constitutionality  of  a\nstatute\tin   a\treference  to\tthe   rights\nguaranteed  in\nArt. 19(1)\nbut the reality\t and\nthe  substance........ Viewed in this way,  it\ndoes  not\t select\t any  of  the  elements\t  or\nattributes of freedom of speech falling within\nArt. 19 (1) (a)\nof the Constitution.\"\nReality and substance test was\nlaid down in\nthis case while,\napproving  of  the  earlier decisions  when  the  court\t was\nconsidering  the question whether the ban  on  advertisement\nwould affect the rights conferred under\nArt. 19(1) (a).\nThe  correctness of the view as\nlaid down in\nGopalan's\tcase\nand  affirmed in\nRam Singh\n's case was doubted by Subba\tRao,\nJ. in\nKochuni v. The State of Madras\n(3).\nThe learned  Judge\nafter  referring to the dissenting view of Fazal Ali, J.  in\nGopalan\n's  case rejecting the plea that a law under\nArt.  21\nshall not infringe\nArt. 19(1)\nobserved :\n\"The  question\tbeing integrated with  the  dissenting\tview\nexpressed by Fazal Ali, J. we are bound by this judgment.\"\nReliance   was\tplaced\tby  the\t learned  counsel  for\t the\npetitioner on the decision by this Court in\nSakal Papers (P)\nLtd. and Ors. v. The Union of India\n. (4) The learned counsel\nreferred to the passage at page 5 60A\n(1)   [1959] 1 S.C.R. 135.\n(2)  [1960] 2 S.C.R. 671 at page 691.\n(3)  [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887.\n(4)  [1962] 3 S.C.R. 842.\n752\nPart where it was held that \"the correct approach ; in\tsuch\ncases  should be to enquire as to what in substance  is\t the\nloss  or  injury  caused to a citizen and  not\tmerely\twhat\nmanner and method has been adopted by ,,he State in  placing\nthe  restriction  and, therefore, the right to\tfreedom,  of\nspeech\tcannot be taken away with the object of taking\taway\nthe business activities of the citizen.\t Reference was\talso\nmade  to another passage at 867 where it 'was held that\t the\n\"legitimacy  of the result intended to be achieved does\t not\nnecessarily  imply  that  every\t means\tto  achieve  it\t  is\npermissible;   for  even  if  the  end\tis   desirable\t and\npermissible,  the  means employed must\tnot  transgress\t the\nlimits\nlaid  down  by\nthe  constitution  if  they  directly\nimpinge\t on any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by\t the\nConstitution.  It is no answer when the constitutionality of\nthe  measure is challenged that apart from  the\t fundamental\nright infringed the provision is otherwise legal.\nThe above observations relied on by the learned counsel were\nmade  in a petition where the validity of  Delhi  Newspapers\n(Price and Page) Order, 1960 which fixed the maximum  number\nof pages that might be published by a newspaper according to\nthe price charged was questioned.  The order was  challenged\nas  contravening\nArt. 19(1) (a)\nof the\t Constitution.\t The\ncourt  held that the order was void as it violated\nArt.  19\n(I) (a)\nof the Constitution and was not saved by\nArticle  19\n(2).\nThe court held that the right extended not merely  to\nthe  method which is employed to circulate but also  to\t the\nvolume of circulation, and the impugned Act and order placed\nrestraints  on\tthe latter aspect of the right as  the\tvery\nobject of the Act was directly against circulation and thus,\ninterfered  with the freedom of speech and  expression.\t  At\npage 866, the Court observed :\n\"The  impugned law far from being\t one,  which\nmerely interferes with the right of freedom of\nspeech incidently, does so directly though  it\nseeks  to\t achieve the end  by  purporting  to\nregulate\t  the\tbusiness   aspect    to\t   a\nnewspaper........\t  Such\ta  course   is\t not\npermissible  and\tthe  courts  must  be\tever\nvigilant in guarding perhaps the most precious\nof   all\t the  freedom  guaranteed   by\t our\nConstitution.\"\nThis  decision\tdoes not help us in resolving the  point  at\nissue  in  this case for the court was\tconcerned  with\t the\nquestion whether the right of freedom of speech was directly\naffected  by the impugned order.  The impact of\t legislation\nunder\nArt. 21\non the rights guaranteed under\nArt. 19(1)\nwas\nnot in issue in the case.\nThe  two cases which were strongly relied on by the  learned\ncounsel for the petitioner as having over-ruled the view  of\nGopalan\n's  case\t as affirmed in\nRam Singh\n's  case  are\nBank\nNationalisation\nCase(\n2) and Bennet Colomon\n's case.(2)\nIn  Kharak Singh's(3) case the majority took the  view\tthat\nthe  word  'liberty'  in\nArt. 21\nis qualified  by  the\tword\n'personal'  and\t there\tits  content  is  narrower  and\t the\nqualifying adjective has been employed in order\n(1)  [1970] 3 S.C.R. 530.\n(2)  [1973] 2 S.C.R. 757.\n(3)  [1964] 1 S.C.R. 332.\n753\nto avoid overlapping between those elements or incidents  of\nliberty\t like freedom of speech or freedom of movement\tetc.\nalready dealt with in\nArt. 19(1)\nand the liberty  guaranteed\nby\nArt. 21\nand particularly in the context of the difference\nbetween\t the  permissible restraints or\t restrictions  which\nmight  be imposed by sub clauses (2) to (6) of the,  Article\nof  the several species of liberty dealt with in  a  several\nclauses of\nArticle 19(1).\nThe minority view as expressed by\nSubba Rao, J. is that if a person's fundamental right  under\nArt.  21\nis  infringed, the State can rely upon  a  law  to\nsustain\t the  action; but that cannot be a  complete  answer\nunless the State laws satisfy the test\nlaid down in\nArticle\n19(2)\nas  far the attributes covered by\nArticle  19(1)\nare\nconcerned.   In\t other words, the State\t must  satisfy\tthat\npetitioners fundamental rights are not infringed by  showing\nthat the law only imposes reasonable restrictions within the\nmeaning\t of\nArt. 19(2)\nof the Constitution.  The  submission\nof  the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the\tview\nas  ,expressed\tby Subba Rao, J. has been  affirmed  by\t the\nsubsequent decisions in the Bank Nationalisation(1) case and\nBennet Colomon(2) case.\nOn  19th  July, 1969, the acting  President  promulgated  an\nordinance  No.\t8 of 1969 transferring to  and\tvesting\t the\nundertaking   of   14\tnames  commercial   banks   in\t the\ncorresponding  new bank under the ordinance.   Subsequently,\nthe  Parliament, enacted\nBanking Companies  (Acquisition  of\nTransfer  of Undertaking) Act, 1969\n.  The object of the\t Act\nwas  to\t provide  for the acquisition and  transfer  of\t the\nundertakings of certain banking companies in conformity with\nthe national policy and objectives and for matters corrected\ntherewith  and incidental thereto.  The\t petitioners  before\nthe Supreme Court who held shares in some of the named banks\nor  had\t accounts  current or fixed deposits  in  the  banks\nchallenged the validity of the enactment.  In the  petitions\nunder\nArt.  32\nof the Constitution  the  validity  of\t the\nOrdinance and the Act was questioned on various grounds.   I\nam concerned with ground no. 3 which runs as follows :\nArticle 19(1) (f)\nand\nArt. 31(2)\nare not mutually  exclusive\nand the law providing for acquisition of property for public\npurpose could be tested for its validity on the ground\tthat\nit  imposes limitation on the right to property\t which\twere\nnot   reasonable;  so  tested  the  provision  of  the\t Act\ntransferring undertaking of the named banks and\t prohibiting\npractically  from  carrying banking  business  violates\t the\nguarantee  under\nArt. 19(1) (f)\nand (g).  In  dealing\twith\nthis contention, the court held that\nArticles 19 (1) (f)\nand\nArticle\t 31  (2)\nare not  mutually  exclusive.\t  The  court\nobserved  that the principle underlying the opinion  of\t the\nmajority in\nGopalan\n's case was extended to the protection of\nthe freedom in respect of property and it was held that\nArt.\n19(1)  (f)\nand\n31(2)\nwere  mutually\texclusive  in  their\noperation and that substantive provisions of law relating to\nacquisition of property were not liable to be challenged  on\nthe ground that it imposes unreasonable restrictions on\t the\nright  to hold pretty.\tAfter mentioning the  two  divergent\nlines of authority, the court held that \"the guarantee under\nArt. 31 (1)\nand\n(2)\narises out of the limitations imposed on\nthe authority of the State,\n(1)   [1970] 3 S.C.R. 530.\n(2)  [1973] 2S.C.R.757.\n754\nby  law, to take over the individual's property.   The\ttrue\ncharacter  of  the limitation of the two provisions  is\t not\ndifferent.  Clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nand clause (1) and\t (2)\nof\nArt.  31\nare  part of the\tsimilar\narticle  19(1)\t (f)\nenunicating  the object specified and\nArticle 19(1)\nand\n31\ndeal with the limitation which may be placed by law  subject\nto  which  the rights may be exercised.\t  Formal  compliance\nwith  the  conditions  of\nArt. 31(2)\nis\t not  sufficient  to\nnegative protection of guarantee to the rights to  property.\nThe validity of law which authorises deprivation of property\nand  the law which authorises compulsory acquisition of\t the\nproperty  for  a  public purpose must  be  adjudged  by\t the\napplication of the same test.  Acquisition must be under the\nauthority of a law and the expression law means a law  which\nis  within  the competence of the legislature and  does\t not\nimpair the guarantee of the rights in Part 111.\nThe  learned  counsel for the petitioner submitted  that  on\nsimilar\t reasoning it is necessary that an  enactment  under\nArt. 21\nmust also satisfy the requirements of\nArticle 19\nand\nshould\tbe  by a law which is within the competence  of\t the\nlegislature and does not impair the guarantee of the  rights\nin  part III including those conferred under\nArt. 19\nof\t the\nConstitution  of India.\t The important question that  arises\nfor  consideration  is\twhether the  decision  in  the\nBank\nNationalisation\ncase\thas  over-ruled\t the   decision\t  of\nGopalan\n's  case and is an authority for the proposition\t and\nan  act of the legislature relating to deprivation  of\tlife\nand   personal\tliberty\t should\t also  satisfy\t the   other\nfundamental  rights  guaranteed\t under\nArt.  19(1)\nof\t the\nConstitution.\nIn order to determine what exactly is the law that has\tbeen\nlaid  down in\nBank Nationalisation\nCase, it is necessary  to\nclosely examine the decision particularly from pages 570  to\n578 of 1970(3) SCR.  After holding that :\n\"Impairment of the right of the individual and\nnot  the\tobject of the State  in\t taking\t the\nimpugned action, is the measure of protection.\nTo  concentrate merely on power of  the  State\nand   the\t object\t of  the  State\t action\t  in\nexercising  that power Is therefore to  ignore\nthe true intent of the Constitution.\"\nthe  Court proceeded to observe that \"the conclusion in\t our\njudgment is inevitable that the validity of the State action\nmust  be adjudged in the light of its operation upon  rights\nof  individual\tand  groups  of\t individuals  in  all  their\ndimensions.\" Having thus held the Court proceeded to state :\n\"But  this Court has held in some cases to  be\npresently\t noticed  that\nArt. 19 (1)  (f)\nand\nArt. 31 (2)\nare mutually exclusive.\"\nIt  is necessary at this stage to emphasize that  the  Court\nwas  only considering the decisions that took the view\tthat\nArticle\t 19  (1\t ) (f)\nand\n31(2)\nwere\tmutually  exclusive.\nAfter referring to passages in\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case at pages\n571 to 573 noted at page 574 :\n\"The  view expressed in A. K.  Gopalan's\tcase\nwas  reaffirmed  in\nRam Singh  and  others  v.\nState of Delhi\n(1)\".\n(1) [1951] S.C.R. 451.\n755\nHaving\tthus  dealt  with the passages in  the\tjudgment  in\nGopalan\n's  case the Court proceeded to consider\t its  effect\nand  observed that the principle underlying the judgment  of\nthe  majority was extended to the protection of\t freedom  in\nrespect\t of property and it was held that-Article 19(1)\t (f)\nand.\nArt. 31(2)\nwere mutually exclusive in their operation.\nWhile observations in judgment of\nGopalan\n's case as  regards\nthe  application  of\nArt. 19(1) (f)\nin relation to\nArt.  21\nwere  not referred to, the Court proceeded to deal with\t the\ncorrectness  of\t the  principle\t in  Gopalan's\tcase   being\nextended  to  the protection of the freedom  in\t respect  of\nproperty.\nIn\nA. K. Gopalan\n's case (supra) Das, J.,  stated\nthat  if the capacity to exercise the right to property\t was\nlost,  because\tof  lawful  compulsory\tacquisition  of\t the\nsubject\t of that right, the owner ceased to have that  right\nfor  the  duration  of the  incapacity.\nIn\nChiranjit\t Lal\nChowduri\n's case,(1) Das, J. observed at page 919 :\n\".  .  . the right to property  guaranteed  by\nArt. 19 (1) (f)\nwould...... continue until the\nowner  was  under\nArt. 31\ndeprived  of\tsuch\nproperty by authority of law.\"\nDas, J. reiterated the same view in\nThe State of West Bengal\nv. Subodh Gopal\n, (2) where he observed :\n\"\nArt.  19(1)  (f)\nread with\nArt.\t 19(5)\npre-\nsupposes\t that\tthe  person  to\t  whom\t the\nfundamental  right is guaranteed\tretains\t his\nproperty\tover or with respect to which  alone\nthat right may be exercised.\nThus  the  observation\tin\nGopalan\n's  case  extending\t the\nprinciple\nlaid down in\nthe majority judgment to. freedom  in\nrespect\t of property was reiterated by Das, J. in\nChiranjit\nLal  Chowduri\n's case (supra) and Subodh Gopal's\t case.\nThe\nprinciple  was given more concrete shape in\nState of  Bombay\nv. Bhanjit Munji\n(3) case wherein it was held that \"if  there\nis  no property which can be acquired held or disposed\tof,.\nno restriction can be placed on the exercise of the right to\nacquire,   hold\t or  dispose  it  of,  and  as\tclause\t (5)\ncontemplates  the placing of reasonable restrictions of\t the\nexercise  of  those rights it must follow that\tthe  Article\npostulates  the existence of property over which the  rights\nare  to be exercised.\"\nThis view was accepted in  the  later\ncases\nDabu  Barkya Thakur v. State of\tBombay\n(\n4)  and\tSmt.\nSitabati Debi and Anr. v. State of West Bengal\n.(5) The Court\nproceeded  further  after referring to some  cases  to\tnote\nthat.\n\"With the decision in\nK. K. Kochuni\n's case(6)  there\narose  two  divergent lines of authority (1)  \"authority  of\nlaw\"  in\nArt. 31 (1)\nis liable to be tested on\t the  ground\nthat  it  violates  other fundamental  rights  and  freedoms\nincluding  the\tright to bold property\tguaranteed  by\nArt.\n19(1)  (f)\nand\n(2) \"\nauthority of law\" within the meaning  of\nArt. 31(2)\nis not liable to be tested on the ground that  it\nimpairs\t the  guarantee of\nArt. 19(1) (f)\nin so\t far  as  it\nimposes substantive restrictions\n(1)  [1950] S.C.R. 869.\n(2)  [1954] S.C.R. 587.\n(3)  [1955] (1) S.C.R. 777.\n(4)  [1961] 1 S.C.R. 128.\n(5)  [1967] 2 S.C.R. 940.\n(6)  [1960] 3 S.C.R. 887.\n756\nthough it may be tested on the ground of impairment of other\nguarantees.\"  Later  in\t the decision  of  State  of  Madhya\nPradesh. v. Ranoiro Shinde(1) the Supreme Court opined\tthat\nthe  validity of law in cl. (2-) of\nArt. 31\nmay be  adjudged\nin the light of\nArt. 19 (1) (f).\nBut the Court\nin that case\ndid  not consider the previous catena of  authorities  which\nrelated\t to the inter--relation between\nArt. 31(2)\nand\nArt.\n19 (1) (f).\nIn  considering the various decisions referred to  regarding\nthe  interrelation  of\nArt. 31 (2)\nand\nArt. 19 (1)  (f)\nthe\nCourt  proceeded to express its view that \"the\ttheory\tthat\nthe object and form of the State action determine the extent\nof  protection\twhich the aggrieved party may claim  is\t not\nconsistent with the constitutional scheme.  Each freedom has\ndifferent dimensions.\" Having so stated the Court considered\nthe  inter-relation of\nArt. 31 (2)\nand\nArt. 19 (1)  (f)\nand\nheld :\n\"The  true character of the limitations  under\nthe  two provisions is not different.   Clause\n(5)\t of\nArt. 19\nand cls. (1) & (2) of\nArt.\t31\nare parts of a single pattern;\nArt. 19(1)\t (f)\nenunciates the basic right to property of\t the\ncitizens and\nArt. 19(5)\nand cls. (1) & (2)  of\nArt.  31\ndeal with limitations which  may  be\nplaced by law, subject to which the rights may\nbe exercised.\"\nIt must be noted that basis for the conclusion is that\nArt.\n19\nand\t cl. ( 1 and (2) of\nArt. 31\nare parts  of  a  single\npattern\t and  while\nArt. 19(1) (f)\nenunciates the  right  to\nacquire,  hold and dispose of property; cl. (5) of\nArt.  19\nauthorise imposition of restrictions upon the right.   There\nmust be reasonable restriction and\nArt. 31\nassures the right\nto  property and grants protection against the\texercise  of\nthe  authority of the State and cl. (5) of\nArt. 19\nand\tcls.\n(1)  and  (2) of\nArt. 31\nprescribe restrictions\t upon  State\naction,\t subject  to  which the right  to  property  may  be\nexercised.  The fact that right to property guaranteed under\nArt.  19(1) (f)\nis subject to restrictions under\nArt.  19(5)\nand\n31\nand thereby relate to the right to property  closely\ninter-related cannot be overlooked for that formed the basis\nfor the conclusion.  After referring to the various Articles\nof the Constitution the Court observed :\n\"The  enunciation of rights either express  or\nby   implication\tdoes  not   follow   uniform\npattern.\t But one thread runs  through  them;\nthey  seek  to  protect  the  rights  of\t the\nindividual  or  group of\tindividuals  against\ninfringement  of those rights within  specific\nlimits.  Part III of the Constitution weaves a\npattern  of guarantees delimit the  protection\nof those rights in their allot fields; they do\nnot attempt to enunciate distinct rights.\"\nIt proceeded\n\"We  are therefore unable to hold that the challenge to\t the\nvalidity  of the provisions for acquisition is liable to  be\ntested only on the ground of non-compliance with\nArt. 31(2).\nArticle 31(2)\nrequires that property must be acquired for  a\npublic purpose and that it must be acquired\n(1) [1968] 3 S.C.R. 489.\n757\nunder  a law with characterstics set out in  that  Articles.\nFormal\tcompliance  of the condition of\nArt.  31(2)\nis\t not\nsufficient  to negative the protection of the  guarantee  of\nthe right to property.\"\nAfter  expressing  its conclusion, the\tCourt  proceeded  to\nstate that it is found necessary to examine the rationale of\nthe  two lines of authority and determine whether  there  is\nanything   in\tthe  Constitution  which  just\t fies\tthis\napparently-inconsistent\t development  of  the  law.    While\nstating\t that  in  its\tjudgment the  assumption  in\nA.  K.\nGopalanan\n's case that certain articles exclusively deal with\nspecific  matters  and\tin  determining\t whether  there\t  is\ninfringement of the individual's guaranteed rights, the\t ob-\nject and the form of State action alone need be\t considered,\nand effect of laws on fundamental rights of the\t individuals\nin  general will be ignored cannot be accepted\tas  correct.\nTo  this extent the Court specifically over ruled  the\tview\nthat  the object and form of the State action alone need  be\nconsidered.   It  proceeded \"We hold the validity  \"of\tlaw\"\nwhich authorities deprivation of property and \"a low\"  which\nauthorises  compulsory\tacquisition of property\t for  public\npurpose\t must  be adjudged by the application  of  the\tsame\ntests.\"\t It will thus be seen that the entire discussion  by\nthe Court in\nBank Nationalisation\ncase related to the inter-\nrelation between\nArt. 31(2)\nand\nArt. 19(1) (f).\nIn  dealing\nwith the question the Court has no doubt extracted  passages\nfrom  the judgments of learned Judges in\nGopalan\n's case\t but\nproceeded  only to consider the extension of the,  principle\nunderlying  the majority judgment to the protection  of\t the\nfreedom\t in respect of property, particularly, the  judgment\nof  Justice Das.\nAfter stating that two views\tarose  after\nKochuni\n's   case   the\tCourt  concerned  itself   only\t  in\ndetermining  the  rationale of the two lines  of  authority.\nThe view taken in\nGopalan\n's case that the objection and\t the\nform of State action has to be considered was over ruled and\nit was laid down that it is the effect and action: upon\t the\nright  of the person that attracts the jurisdiction  of\t the\nCourt  to  grant relief.  It is no doubt true  that  certain\npassing observations have been made regarding the liberty of\npersons, such as at page 576 :\n\"We  have\t carefully  considered\tthe  weighty\npronouncements of the eminent judges who\tgave\nshape  to\t the  concept  that  the  extent  of\nprotection of important guarantees such as the\nliberty  of  person, and\tright  to  property,\ndepends  upon  the form and  object  of  State\naction and not upon its direct operation\tupon\nthe individual's freedom.\"\nThough the liberty of person is incidentally mentioned there\nis no further discussion on the subject.  While\t undoubtedly\nBank  Nationalisation\ncase settles the law that\nArt.  19(1)\n(f)  and\nArt. 31(2)\nare not mutually exclusive there  is  no\njustification  for holding that the case. is  authority\t for\nthe  proposition that the legislation under\nArt.  21\nshould\nalso  satisfy  all the fundamental rights  guaranteed  under\nArt.. 19(1) of the Constitution.  As emphasised earlier\nArt.\n19  (1) (f)\nand\nArt. 31 (2)\nform a single pattern  and\tdeal\nwith  right to property.  The fundamental right\t under\nArt.\n19(1) (f)\nis restricted under\nArt. 19(5)\nor\nArt. 31 (2)\nand\nas  the\t article  refer to right to  property  they  are  so\nclosely\t interlinked,  and  cannot be held  to\tbe  mutually\nexclusive.   But\nArt. 21\nis related to deprivation  of\tlife\nand personal liberty and it has been held\n758\nthat  it is not one of the rights enumerated in\nArt.  19(1)\nand  refers  only to personal rights as are not\t covered  by\nArticle 19.\nThe  decision  in\nBank Nationalisation\ncase so\t far  as  it\nrelates to\nArticles 19(1)\nand\n21\n, is in the nature of obiter\ndicta.\tThough it is a decision of a Court of 11 Judges\t and\nis  entitled  to the highest regard, as the  Court  had\t not\napplied its mind and decided the specific question and as is\nin  the nature of a general, casual observation-on  a  point\nnot calling for decision and not obviously argued before it,\nthe case cannot be taken as an authority on the\t proposition\nin question.  The Court cannot be said to have declared\t the\nlaw on the subject when no occasion arose for it to consider\nand decide the question.\nIt  may\t also  be noted that as the  Court  ruled  that\t the\nimpugned  Act  violated\nArt. 31 (2)\nby not laying  down\t the\nnecessary principles, the decision of the inter-relationship\nbetween\nArt. 19(1) (f)\nand\n31(2)\nwas not strictly  necessary\nfor the purpose of giving relief to the petitioner.  We\t are\nnot  concerned\tin this case as to whether the\tdecision  in\nBank  Nationalisation\ncase is in the nature of Obiter  dicta\nso   far  as  it  held\tthat  Arts.  19(1)  and\t 31(2)\t are\ninterrelated.\tBut  it\t is  necessary\tto  state  that\t the\ndecision  proceeded on some erroneous assumptions.\nAt\tpage\n571  of flank Nationalisation case (supra) it  was  assumed.\n\"The  Majority\tof  the Court  (Kania,\tC.J.  and  Patanjali\nSastri,\t Mahajan,  Mukherjea & Das JJ.) held  that\nArt.  22\nbeing  a complete code relating to preventive detention\t the\nvalidity  of  an  order\t of  detention\tmust  be  determined\nstrictly  according to the terms and within the four  comers\nof that articles.\" This statement is not borne out from\t the\ntext  of  the  judgment$ in\nGopalan\n's case.\nAt\t p.  115  of\nGopalan\n's case (supra) Kania C.J. has stated : \"The  learned\nAttorney  General contended that the- subject of  preventive\ndetention  does\t not  fall under\narticle 21\nat\t au  and  is\ncovered wholly by\narticle 22.\nAccording to him,\narticle  22\nis a complete code.  I am unable to accept that contention.\"\nPatanjali Sastri J. at page 207 of the judgment said :\t\"The\nlearned\t Attorney General contended that\narticle 22\nclauses\n(4)  to\t (7)  formed  a\t complete  code\t of   constitutional\nsafeguards in respect of preventive detention, and, provided\nonly these provisions are conformed to, the validity of\t any\nlaw   relating\t to  preventive\t detention  could   not\t  be\nchallenged.   I am unable to agree with this view\".  Das  J.\nin referring to the Attorney General's argument at page\t 324\nstated : \"that\narticle 21\nhas nothing to do with  preventive\ndetention  at  all and that preventive detention  is  wholly\ncovered\t by\narticle  22(4)\nto\t (7)  which  by\t  themselves\nconstitute  a complete code.  I am unable to accede to\tthis\nextreme point of view also.\" Mukherjea J. at p. 229 of\tthat\njudgment observed : \"1t is also unnecessary to enter into  a\ndiscussion  on the question raised by the learned  Attorney-\nGeneral\t as  to\t whether\narticle 22\nby\titself\tis  a  self-\ncontained  Code,  with\tregard\tto  the\t law  of  preventive\ndetention  and whether or not the procedure it lays down  is\nexhaustive.\"  Justice  Mahajan at page 226 held that  \"I  am\nsatisfied  on  a  review of the whole  scheme  of  the\tCon-\nstitution  that the intention was to make\narticle  22\nself-\ncontained  in  respect\tof  the\t laws  on  the\tsubject\t  of\npreventive  detention.\" It is thus seen that the  assumption\nin\nBank  Nationalisation\n's case that the  majority  of\t the\nCourt  held that\narticle 22\nis a complete code is  erroneous\nand the basis of the decision stands shaken.  If the  obiter\ndicta based\n759\non  the\t wrong\tassumption is to be  taken  as\tthe  correct\nposition in law, it would lead to strange results.  If arts.\n19(1)  (a)  to\t(e) and (g) are attracted  in  the  case  of\ndeprivation  of personal liberty under\nart. 21\n,\t a  punitive\ndetention  for an offence committed under the\nIndian  Penal\nCode\nsuch as theft, cheating or assault would be illegal  as\npointed out in\nGopalan\n's case by Kania C.J. and Patan ' jali\nSastri J. for the reasonable restriction in the interest  of\npublic\torder would not cover the offences mentioned  above.\nAs held in Gopalan\"s case and in\nSaha\n's case there can be no\ndistinction between punitive detention under the Penal Code,\nand  preventive\t detention.\nAs pointed  out  earlier\teven\nthough\tFazal Ali J. dissented in\nGopalan\n's case,  the\tsame\nview  was  expressed  by His Lordship  so  far\tas  punitive\ndetention  was concerned.  He said : \"The\nIndian Penal\tCode\ndoes not primarily or necessarily impose restrictions on the\nfreedom of movement and it is not correct to say that it  is\na  law imposing restrictions on the right to  move  freely.\"\nThe  conclusion that\nart. 19 (1)\nand\nArt. 21\nwere  mutually\nexclusive was arrived at on an interpretation of language of\nart.  19 (1) (d)\nread with\nart. 19(5)\nand not on  the  basis\nthat\nart. 19(1)\nand\n21\nare exclusive and\nArt. 21\na  complete\ncode.\tThe  words  \"Personal liberty\" based  on  the  Draft\nCommittee  report on\nArt. 15 (now\nArt. 21\n)\nwas added to\t the\nword   'personal'  before  the\tword  'liberty'\t  with\t the\nobservation  that the word 'liberty' should be qualified  by\nthe  word  'personal'  before it for  otherwise\t it  may  be\nconstrued  very\t wide  so as to include\t even  the  freedoms\nalready\t dealt with in\nArt. 13 (now\nArt. 19\n).\nIn  Gopalan's\ncase  it was also pointed out by the Judges that\nart.  19(1)\nand\n21\ndid not operate on the same field as\nArt. 19(1)\nand\n31(2)\nof the Constitution are.\t The right under\nArt. 21\nis\ndifferent  and does not include the rights that are  covered\nunder\nart.  19.\nArt. 19(1)\nconfers  substantive  right  as\nmentioned  in clauses. (a) to (g) on citizen alone and\tdoes\nnot  include the right of personal liberty covered  in\tArt.\n21.   For  the\treasons stated above obiter  dicta  in\nBank\nNationalisation\n's  case\t that a legislation  under\nart.  21\nshould also satisfy the requirements of\nArt. 19(1)\ncannot be\ntaken  as  correct law.\nThe Court has\tnot  considered\t the\nreasoning in\nGopalan\n's case and over-ruled it.\nBefore\tproceeding  to consider the test of  validity  of  a\nlegislation as\nlaid down in\nBennet Colomon\n's case  following\nthe\nBank Nationalisation\n,case the decisions which  followed\nthe\nBank  Nationalisation\ncase holding  on  the  erroneous\npremises  that\tthe  majority in\nGopalan\n's  case  held\tthat\nArticle\t 22\nwas  a self-contained  Code.\nmay\tbe  shortly-\nreferred to.  In\nS. N. Sarkar v. West Bengal\n(1), the Supreme\nCourt  held that in\nGopalan\n's case the majority\t Court\theld\nthat\nArticle 22\nwas a self-contained Code  and,  therefore,\nthe law or preventive detention did not have to satisfy\t the\nrequirement  of\nArticles  19\n,\t14\nand\n20.\nIn  the\nBank\nNationalisation\ncase the aforesaid premise in\tGopalan\t was\ndisapproved  and; therefore, it no longer holds\t the  field.\nThough the Bank Nationalisation\ncase dealt with in  relation\nto\nArticle  19\nand\n31\n, the basic approach  considering\t the\nfundamental rights guaranteed in-the different provisions of\nthe  Constitution adopted in this case held the\t major\tpre-\nmises  of  the majority in the\nGopalan\ncase  was  erroneous.\nThe  view  taken  in this case also suffers  from  the\tsame\ninfirmities referred to in\n(1)  [1973] 1 S.C.C. 856.\n760\nBank Nationalisation\ncase.\nLater, in the case of  Khundiran\nv. West Bengal(1), a Bench of four Judges again\t erroneously\nstated\tthat\nGopalan\n's case had taken the view that\nArticle\n22\nwas   a  complete\tCode.\nAfter  referring   to\nBank\nNationalisation\ncase and S. N. Sarkar's and to the case  of\nH.  Saha v. State of West Bengal(2) the Court  regarded\t the\nquestion  as  concluded\t and  a\t final\tseal  put  on\tthis\ncontroversy and hold'that in view of the decision, it is not\nopen  to any one now to contend that the law  of  preventive\ndetention  which falls in\nArticle 22\ndoes not have  to\tmeet\nthe requirement of\nArt. 14\nor Art. 19.\"\nIn\nAdditional District Magistrate v. S. S.  Shukla\n,(3)\t the\nlocus standi to move a habeas corpus petition under\nArticle\n226\nof\t the Constitution of India  while  the\tPresidential\norder  dated  27th  June,  1975 was  in\t force\tfell  to  be\nconsidered.\nThe Court while holding that the remedy by\t way\nof  writ petition to challenge the legality of an  order  of\ndetention under the\nMaintenance of Internal Security Act\nis\nnot  open to a detenu during the emergency, had occasion  to\nconsider  the  observations  made by the  majority  in\nBank\nNationalisation\ncase regarding the application of\nArt. 21\nof\nthe  Constitution of India.  Chief Justice Ray, at page\t 230\nheld :\n\"\nArticle 21\nis our rule of law regarding\tlife\nand  liberty.  No, other rule of law can\thave\nseparate\texistence as a distinct right.\t The\nnegative\t language   of\t fundamental   right\nincorporated  in Part III imposes\t limitations\non  the  power of the State and  declares\t the\ncorresponding  guarantee of the individual  to\nthat  fundamental right.\tThe  limitation\t and\nguarantee\t are complimentary.  The  limitation\nof  State\t action embodied  in  a\t fundamental\nright couched in negative form is the  measure\nof the protection of the individual.\"\nAfter quoting with approval the view held in Kharak  Singh's\ncase  that  ,personal  liberty\tin\nArt.  21\nincludes\t all\nvarieties of rights which go to make personal liberty  other\nthan  those in\nArt. 19(1)\n, the learned Judge  observed\tthat\nthe\nBank Nationalisation\ncase merely brings in the  concept\nof  reasonable restriction in the law.\tJustice Beg,  as  he\nthen  was, considered this aspect a little more\t elaborately\nat  page  322.\nAfter\treferring to  the  passage  in\nBank\nNationalisation\ncase the learned Judge observed :\n\"It seems to me that\nGopalan\n's case was merely\ncited in Cooper's case for illustrating a line\nof reasoning which was held to be incorrect in\ndetermining  the\tvalidity of  'law'  for\t the\nacquisition of property solely with  reference\nto  the provisions of\nArt. 31.\nThe  question\nunder  consideration in that case was  whether\nArticles\t19 (1) (f)\nand\n31 (2)\nare  mutually\nexclusive.\"\nThe  learned Judge did not understand the Cooper's  case  as\nholding that effect of deprivation of rights outside\nArt. 21\nwill also have to\n(1)  [1975] 2 S.C.C. 81.\n(2)  [1975] 1 S.C.R. 778.\n(3)  [1976] Supp.  S.C.R. 172.\n761\nbe considered.\tJustice Chandrachud understood the  decision\nin\nBank  Nationalisation\ncase as holding that\nArt.  21\nand\nArt.  19\ncannot be treated as mutually\texclusive.\nJustice\nBhagwati  at page 433 of the reports took the view  that  in\nview  of  the decision of this Court in\t Cooper's  case\t the\nminority view in Kharak Singh's case that the law under\nArt.\n21\nmust also satisfy the test laid down in\nArt. 19(1)\nso far\nthe  attributes\t covered  by\nArt. 19(1)\nare  concerned\t was\napproved.\nIt\tis  seen that the view\ttaken  in  the\nBank\nNationalisation\ncase that a law relating to deprivation  of\nlife and personal liberty falling under\nArt. 21\nhas to\tmeet\nthe requirements of\nArt. 19\nis due to an error in proceeding\non the basis that the majority Court in\nGopalan\n's case\theld\nthat\nArticle 22\nwas a self contained code.\nThe  decisions\nwhich  followed\nBank Nationalisation\ncase, namely, the\tcase\nof\nS. N. Sarkar v. West Bengal\nand Khundiram v. West Bengal,\nH.  Saha  v. West Bengal\n, suffer from  the  same  infirmity.\nWith  respect  I  agree with the  view\texpressed  by  Chief\nJustice\t Ray  and Justice Beg, as be then was,\tin  Shukla's\ncase.\nNext to Bank Nationalisation\ncase strong reliance was placed\non\nBennet  Colomon\n's  case  by\t the,  petitioner  for\t the\nproposition that the direct effect of the legislation of the\nfundamental rights is the test.\nIn  the\t case  the petitioners impugned\t the  new  newsprint\npolicy\ton  various  grounds.  The Court  held\tthat  though\nArticle\t 19(1)(a)\ndoes not mention the freedom of press,  it\nis  settled  view of the Court that freedom  of\t speech\t and\nexpression  includes  freedom  of  press  and\tcirculation.\nHolding\t that  the  machinery of import\t control  cannot  be\nutilised to control or curb circulation or growth of freedom\nof newspapers it was held that Newspapers Control Policy  is\nultra-vires of the Import Control Act and the Import Control\nOrder.\tThe Court after referring to the two tests\nlaid down\nin\nBank Nationalisation\ncase observed : \"Direct operation of\nthe  Act upon the right forms the real test\".  The  question\nthat  was  raised  in  the case\t was  whether  the  impugned\nnewsprint policy is in substance a newspaper control.\tThe,\nCourt held that the Newsprint Control Policy is found to  be\nNewspaper  Control Order in the, guise of framing an  import\ncontrol\t policy fog newsprint.\tAs the direct  operation  of\nthe Act was to abridge the freedom of speech and expression,\nthe Court held that the pith and substance doctrine does not\narise in the present case.\nOn the facts of the case  there,\nwas no need to apply the doctrine of pith and substance\nIt  may be noted that in\nBennet Colomon\n's case the  question\nwhether\nArticles 21\nand\n19\nare mutually exclusive or not did\nnot arise for consideration and the case cannot be taken  as\nan  authority  for the question under consideration  in\t the\ncase.\nBennet Colomon\n's case,\nExpress Newspapers\ncase,\nSakal\nNewspapers\ncase were all concerned with the right to freedom\nof the press which is held to form part of freedom of speech\nand expression.\nWhether\t the  pith  and substance doctrine  is\trelevant  in\nconsidering  the  question of  infringement  of\t fundamental\nrights,\t the  Court  observed  at  page\t 780  of  the\nBank\nNationalisation\ncase \"Mr.  Palkhivala said that the tests of\npith and substance of the subject matter and of direct\n762\nand of incidental effect of the legislation are relevant  to\nquestion  of legislative competence but they are  irrelevant\nto  the question of infringement of fundamental rights.\t  In\nour   view  this  is  a\t sound\tand  correct   approach\t  to\ninterpretation\tof legislative measures and State action  in\nrelation to fundamental rights.\" It is thus clear, that\t the\ntest  of  pith and substance of the subject  matter  and  of\ndirect\tand incidental effect of legislation is relevant  in\nconsidering  the  question of  infringement  of\t fundamental\nright.\nThe  Court at page 781 said : \"by direct operation is  meant\nthe direct consequence or effect of the Act upon the  rights\nand  quoted  with approval the test\nlaid down by\nthe  Privy\nCouncil\t in Commonwealth of Australia v. Bank of  New  South\nWales.(1)\nIn  deciding whether the Act has got a direct  operation  of\nany  rights upon the fundamental rights, the two tests\tare,\ntherefore,  relevant and applicable.\nThese tests have\tbeen\napplied\t in  several  cases  before  the  decision  in\nBank\nNationalisation\ncase.\nA reference has been  made  to\t the\ndecision  of\nExpress Newspapers (P) Ltd. and Anr.  V.  Union\nof India\n,(2) where the test laid down was that there must be\na direct and inevitable consequence of the legislation.\nIn\nHamdard Dawakhana v. Union of, India\n(3) this Court  followed\nthe  test\nlaid down in\nExpress Newspapers\ncase.\nThe  Court\nexpressed  its\tview that it is not the form  or  incidental\ninfringement  that determine constitutionality of a  statute\nbut reality and substance' In\nSakal Papers (P) Ltd. v. Union\nof  India\n(4) it was held that the \"Correct approach in\tsuch\ncases  should be to enquire as to what in substance  is\t the\nloss  or  injury caused to the citizen and not\tmerely\twhat\nmanner and method have been adopted by the State in  placing\nthe   restriction.   The:  Supreme  Court  in\tsome   cases\nconsidered;  whether  the effect of the,  operation  of\t the\nlegislation  is\t direct\t and immediate or  not.\t  If  it  is\nremote,\t  incidental  or  indirect,  the  validity  of\t the\nenactment  will not be effected.  The decision\tin  Copper's\ncase has not rejected the above test.  The test\nlaid down in\ncooper's  case is the direct operation on the rights of\t the\nperson.\nThe test was adopted and explained in Bennet Colomon's\tcase\nas pointed above.\nThe  view  that pith and substance rule is not\tconfined  in\nresolving conflicts between legislative powers is made clear\nin  the\t decision  of  the  Federal  Court  in\t Subramaniam\nChettiar's  case,(5) where Vardachariar, J. after  referring\nbriefly\t to the decision of Gallagher V. Lynn,(6) held\tthat\n\"They  need not be limited to any special system of  federal\nconstitution  is made clear by the fact hat in Gallagher  V.\nLynn,  Lord  Atkin  applied pith  and  substance  rule\twhen\ndealing\t with  a question arising under\t the  Government  of\nIreland Act which did not embody a federal system at all.\"\n(1) [1950] A.

C. 863.\n763\nThe passport Act provides for issue of passports and  travel\ndocuments  for\tregulating  the\t departure  from  India\t  of\ncitizens  of  India and other persons.\t If  the  provisions\ncomply\twith  the requirements of\nArticle 2 1\n, that  is,  if\nthey  comply  with  the procedure  established\tby  law\t the\nvalidity  of the Act cannot be challenged.  If\tincidentally\nthe  Act  infringes on the rights of a\tcitizen\t under\nArt.\n19(1)\nthe Act cannot be found to be invalid.  The pith\t and\nsubstance rule will have to be applied and unless the rights\nare  directly affected, the challenge will fail.  If  it  is\nmeant  as being applicable in every case however  remote  it\nmay  be\t where\tthe citizen's rights under\nArt.  19(1)\nare\naffected, punitive detention will not be valid.\nThe  result  of\t the  discussion,  therefore,  is  that\t the\nvalidity of the\nPassport Act\nwill have to be examined on the\nbasis  whether it directly and immediately infringes on\t any\nof the fundamental right of the petitioner. If\ta  passport\nis  refused according to procedure established by  law,\t the\nplea that his other fundamental rights are denied cannot  be\nraised if they are not directly infringed.\nThe  decisions\tof the Supreme Court wherein  the  right  of\nperson to travel abroad has been dealt with may be  noticed.\nIn\nSatwant Singh v. Assistant Passport Officer, Delhi\n(1) the\nCourt  held  that  though a passport was  not  required\t for\nleaving,  for practical purposes no one can leave  or  enter\ninto  India  without a passport.  Therefore, a\tpassport  is\nessential  for leaving and entering India.  The\t Court\theld\nthe right to travel is part of personal liberty and a person\ncould  not  be\tdeprived  of  it  except  according  to\t the\nprocedure\nlaid down by\nlaw.  The view taken by the  majority\nwas  that  the expression \"personal liberty\" in\nArticle  21\nonly  excludes the ingredients of liberty enshrined in\nArt.\n19\nof the Constitution and the exression 'personal  liberty'\nwould  take  in the right to travel abroad.  This  right  to\ntravel abroad is not absolute and is liable to be restricted\naccording to the procedure established by law.\tThe decision\nhas made it clear that \"personal liberty\" is 'not one of the\nrights secured under\nArticle 19\nand, therefore, liable to be\nrestricted  by\tthe legislature according to  the  procedure\nestablished  by\t law.  The right of an American\t citizen  to\ntravel\tis  recognised.\nIn Kent v.  Dulles,(2)  the  Court\nobserved that the right to travel is a part of the 'liberty'\nof which the citizen cannot be deprived without due  process\nof law under the Fifth Amendment.  \"The freedom of  movement\nacross\tthe  frontiers\tin  either  direction,\tand   inside\nfrontiers as well, as a part of our heritage, Travel abroad,\nlike travel within the country...... may be as close to\t the\nheart  of the individual as the choice of what he  eats,  or\nwears, or reads.  Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme\nof  values.\" In a subsequent decision--Zemel v. Rusk(3)\t the\nCourt sustained against due process attacks the Government's\nrefusal\t to issue passports for travel to Ouba\tbecause\t the\nrefusal\t was  grounded\ton  foreign  policy   considerations\naffecting  all citizens.  \"The requirements of\tdue  process\nare  a function not only of the extent of  the\tgovernmental\nrestriction imposed, but also of the extent of the necessity\nfor the restriction.\"\n(1)  [1967] 2 S.C.R. 525.\n(2)  357 U. S. page 116, at page 127 (1958).\n(3)  381 U.S. (1) at page 14.\n764\n(The  Constitution  of the  United  States  of\nAmerica-Analysis\tand  interpretation-at\tpage\n1171)\nIn Herbert Aptheker etc. v. Secretary of State,(1) the Court\nstruck\tdown  a congressional prohibition  of  international\ntravel\tby members of the Communist Party.  In a  subsequent\ndecision the Court upheld the Government's refusal to  issue\npassports  for\ttravel to Cuba, because the refusal  was  on\nforeign\t policy consideration affecting all citizens  [Zenel\nv,  Rusk  (supra)].  Thus an American's citizen's  right  to\ntravel\t abroad\t may  also  be\trestricted   under   certain\nconditions.   Our Constitution provides for  restriction  of\nthe  rights by 'procedure established by law'.\tIt  will  be\nnecessary to consider whether the impugned\nAct, Passport Act\nsatisfies the requirements of procedure established by law.\nThe  procedure established by law does not  mean  procedure,\nhowever,  fantastic  and oppressive or\tarbitrary  which  in\ntruth and reality is no procedure at all [(\nA.  K. Gopalan v.\nState  of  Madras\n) (1) observations of Mahajan,\t J.].  There\nmust  be some procedure and at least it must confirm to\t the\nprocedure  established by law must be taken to mean  as\t the\nordinary and well established criminal procedure, that is to\nsay,  those settled usages and normal modes of\tproceedings,\nsanctioned by the\nCriminal Procedure Code\nwhich is a general\nlaw  of\t Criminal procedure in the Country.  But  as  it  is\naccepted that procedure established by law refers to statute\nlaw  and  as  the legislature is  competent  to\t change\t the\nprocedure  the\tprocedure  as  envisaged  in  the   criminal\nprocedure  cannot  be insisted upon as the  legislature\t can\nmodify\tthe  procedure.\t The Supreme Court  held  in  Kartar\nSingh's\t case(3) that Regulation 236 clause (b) of the\tU.P.\nPolice\tRegulation which authorises domiciliary visits\twhen\n'there was no law on such a regulation, violated\nArticle 21.\nI  will not proceed to examine the provisions\tof\nPassport\nAct, Act\n15 of 1967, to determine whether the Provisions  of\nthe Act are in accordance with the procedure established  by\nlaw.\nThe Preamble states that the Act is to provide for the issue\nof passports and travel documents to regulate the  departure\nfrom  India of citizens of India and other persons  and\t for\nmatters\t  incidental  or  ancillary  thereto.\tIt  may\t  be\nremembered that this Act was passed after the Supreme  Court\nhad  held  in Satwant Singh V. Union of India'(1)  that\t the\nright to tavel abroad is a part of person's personal liberty\nof which he could not be deprived except in accordance\twith\nthe  procedure established by law in terms of\nArticle 21\nof\nthe  Constitution.  The legislature came forward  with\tthis\nenactment  prescribing the procedure for issue of  passports\nfor  regulating\t the departure from India  of  citizens\t and\nothers.\n(1) 378 U.S. 500.\n(2) [1950] S.C.R. 88 at page 230.\n(3) [1963] 1 S.C.R. 332.\n(4) [1967] 3 S.C.R. 525.\n765\nSection 5\nof the Act provides for applying for passports  or\ntravel\tdocuments etc. and the procedure for passing  orders\nthereon.  On receipt of an application under sub-section (2)\nthe  passport  authority may issue a passport  or  a  travel\ndocument   with\t endorsement  in  respect  of  the   foreign\ncountries  specified in the application or issue of a  pass-\nport or travel document with endorsement in respect of\tsome\nforeign\t countries  and\t refuse to make\t an  endorsement  in\nrespect of other countries or to refuse to issue a  passport\nor travel document and to refuse to make on the passport  or\ntravel\tdocument  any  endorsement.  In\t the  event  of\t the\npassport  authority  refusing  to  make\t an  endorsement  as\napplied\t for  or  refusal to issue a passport  or  a  travel\ndocument  or  refusal  of  endorsement,\t the  authority\t  is\nrequired  to  record  in writing a brief  statement  of\t its\nreasons\t and  furnish  to that person,\ton  demand,  a\tcopy\nthereof\t unless the authority for reasons specified in\tsub-\nsection\t (3) refuses to furnish a copy.\nSection 6\nprovides\nthat  the refusal to make an endorsement shall be on one  or\nother grounds mentioned in sub-sections (2) to (6).\nSection\n8\nprovides that every passport shall be renewable  for\t the\nsame  period  for which the passport was  originally  issued\nunless the passport authority for reasons to be recorded  in\nwiting otherwise determines.\nSection\t 10\nis\t most important as  the\t impounding  of\t the\npassport ,of the petitioner was ordered under\nsection  10(3)\n(c)  of\t the  Act.\nSection  10(1)\nenables  the   passport\nauthority to vary or cancel the endorsement on a passport or\ntravel\tdocument  or may with the previous approval  of\t the\nCentral Government, vary or cancel the conditions subject to\nwhich  a  passport or travel document has been\tissued,\t and\nrequire-  the holder of a passport or a travel\tdocument  by\nnotice\tin  writing, to deliver up the\tpassport  or  travel\ndocument  to it within such time as may be specified in\t the\nnotice.\t Sub-section (2) enables the bolder of a passport or\na  travel document to vary or cancel the conditions  of\t the\npassport.\nSection 10(3)\nwith which we are concerned runs\nas follows\n10(3).-The  passport authority may impound  or\ncause to be impounded or revoke a passport  or\ntravel document,-\n(a)  If  the passport authority  is  satisfied\nthat  the\t holder of the\tpassport  or  travel\ndocument is in wrongful possession of;\n(b)  If  the passport or travel  document\t was\nobtained\t by  the  suppression  of   material\ninformation   or\t on  the  basis\t  of   wrong\ninformation  provided  by the  holder  of\t the\npasspot or travel document or any other person\non his behalf;\n(c)   If\tthe  passport  authority  deems\t  it\nnecessary\t so  to do in the interests  of\t the\nsovereignity  and\t integrity  of\tIndia,\t the\nsecurity of India, friendly relations of India\nwith any foreign country, or in the  interests\nof the general public;\n766\n(d)  If  the holder of the passpot  or  travel\ndocument\thas, at any time after the issue  of\nthe passort or travel document, been convicted\nby a court in India for any offence  involving\nmoral  turpitude\tand  sentenced\tin   respect\nthereof to imprisonment for not less than\t two\nyears;\n(c)  If proceedings in respect of\t an  offence\nalleged  to have been committed by the  holder\nof the passport or travel document are pending\nbefore a criminal court in India;\n(f)  If any of the conditions of the  passport\nor travel document has been contravened;\n(g)  If the holder of the passport  or  travel\ndocument\thas failed to comply with  a  notice\nunder sub-section (1)requiring him to  deliver\nup the same.\n(b)  If  it is brought to the  notice  of\t the\npassport\tauthority that a warrant or  summons\nfor  the\tappearance  or\ta  warrant  for\t the\narrest,  of  the\tholder of  the\tpassport  or\ntravel  document\thas been issued by  a  court\nunder  any law for the time being in force  or\nif  an  order prohibiting the  departure\tfrom\nIndia  of the holder of the passport or  other\ntravel  document\thas been made  by  any\tsuch\ncourt and the passport authority is  satisfied\nthat  a warrant or summons has been so  issued\nor an order has been so made.\"\nSection 10(3) (c)\nenables the passport authority to  impound\nor  revoke  a passport if the passport\tauthority  deems  it\n'necessary so to do in the interests of the sovereignty\t and\nintegrity   of\tIndia,\tthe  security  of  India,   friendly\nrelations  of  India  with any foreign country,\t or  in\t the\ninterests of the general public.\nSection\t 10(5)\nrequires the passport authority to record  in\nwriting a brief statement of the reasons for making an order\nunder sub-section (1) or(3) and to furnish the holder of the\npassport on demand a copy of the same unless in any case the\npassport authority is of the opinion that it will 'not be in\nthe  interests\tof the sovereignty and integrity  of  India,\nthe, security of India, friendly relations of India with any\nforeign country or in the interests of the general public to\nfurnish\t such a copy.\nSection 11\nprovides for an appeal  by\nthe  aggrieved\tperson\tagainst\t any  order  passed  by\t the\npassport  authority under several clauses mentioned in\tsub-\nsection\t (1) of that section.

It\t was\ncontended  that the power conferred on the authority to\t im-\npound a passport in the interests of general public is\tvery\nvague and in the absence of proper guidance an order by\t the\nauthority  impounding  the  passport \"in  the  interests  of\ngeneral\t public\" without any explanation is not valid.\t The\nlast  ground may easily be disposed of.\t The words  'in\t the\ninterests  of  general\tpublic'\t no  doubt  are\t of  a\twide\nconnotation but the authority in construing the facts of the\ncase should determine whether in the interests of public the\npassport  will\thave to be impounded.  Whether\tthe  reasons\ngiven have annexus to the interests of general public  would\ndepend\tupon the facts of each case.  The plea that  because\nof  the\t vagueness of the words 'interests  of\tthe  general\npublic'\t in  the order, the order itself  is  unsustainable,\ncannot be accepted.\nThe  submission\t that  in the context the  rule\t of  natural\njustice,  that\tis,  the  right to be  beard  has  not\tbeen\nexpressly  or by necessary implication taken  away  deserves\ncareful\t consideration.\t  Under\nSection 10(3)\nthe  passport\nauthority  is authorised to impound or revoke a passport  on\nany  of the grounds specified in clauses (a) to (h) of\tsub-\nsection\t (3).\tSub-\nsection 3(a)\nenables  the  authority  to\nimpound\t a  passport  if the bolder of the  passport  is  in\nwrongful  possession  thereof.\tUnder sub-\nsection  3(b)\nthe\nauthority  can impound a passport if it was obtained by\t the\nsuppression of material information or on the basis of wrong\ninformation  provided by the holder of the passport.   Under\nclause\t(d)  a passport can be impounded if the\t holder\t bad\nbeen convicted by a Court of India for any offence involving\nmoral  turpitude and sentenced to imprisonment for not\tless\nthan  two  years.   Under clause (e)  the  passport  can  be\nimpounded where\n768\nproceedings  in respect of an offence alleged to  have\tbeen\ncommitted  by the holder of a passport is pending  before  a\ncriminal  court in India.  Clause (f) enables the  authority\nto  impound  the passport if any of the\t conditions  of\t the\npassport  have\tbeen  contravened.   Under  clause  (g)\t the\npassport authority can act if the holder of the passport had\nfailed\tto  comply  with  a  notice  under  sub-section\t (1)\nrequiring him to deliver up the same.  Under sub-clause\t (h)\na  passport may be impounded if it is brought to the  notice\nof  the\t passport authority that a warrant  or\tsummons\t for\nappearance of the holder of the passport has been issued  by\nany court or if there is an order prohibiting departure from\nIndia  of  the\tholder of the passport has been\t made  by  a\ncourt.\tIt will be noticed that when action is\tcontemplated\nunder any of the clauses (a), (b), (d), (e), (f) and (h), it\nis  presumed  that the authority will give notice,  for\t the\npassport authority cannot be satisfied under sub-clause\t (a)\nthat the holder is in\t      wrongful possession thereof or\nunder\tclause\t(b)  that  he  obtained\t the   passport\t  by\nsuppression of material information.  Similarly under clause\n(d) whether a person has been convicted by a court in  India\nfor  any offence involving moral turpitude and sentenced  to\nimprisonment  for  not\tless than two  years,  can  only  be\nascertained after hearing the holder of the passport.  Under\nclause\t(e) the fact whether proceedings   in respect of  an\noffence alleged to have been committed by the holder of\t the\npassport  are  pending before a criminal court can  only  be\ndetermined after notice to him.\t Equally whether a condition\nof  passport  has been contravened under sub-clause  (f)  or\nwhether\t he  has failed to comply with a notice\t under\tsub-\nsection (1) can be ascertained only after hearing the holder\nof  the\t passport.  Under clause (h) also a hearing  of\t the\nholder\tof the passport is presumed.  Reading clause (c)  in\njuxtaposition  with  other  'Sub-clauses, it  will  have  to\ndetermined  whether it was the intention of the\t legislature\nto deprive a right of hearing to the holder of the  passport\nbefore\tit is impounded or revoked.  In this connection,  it\ncannot\tbe denied that the legislature by making an  express\nprovision may deny a person the right to be heard.  Rules of\nnatural\t justice  cannot  be equated  with  the\t Fundamental\nRights.\t  As held by the Supreme Court in\nUnion of India  v.\nJ.  N.\t Sinha\n,(1) that \"Rules of natural  justice  are\t not\nembodied  rules nor can they be elevated to the position  of\nFundamental  Rights.  Their aim is to secure justice  or  to\nprevent miscarriage of justice.These rules can operate\tonly\nin  areas not covered by any law validly made.\tThey do\t not\nsupplant  the  law  but\t supplement  it.   If  a   statutory\nprovision  can be read consistently With the  principles  of\nnatural\t justice,  the\tcourts\tshould do  'so.\t  But  if  a\nstatutory  provision  either specifically  or  by  necessary\nimplication excludes the application of any rules of natural\njustice\t then  the court cannot ignore the  mandate  of\t the\nlegislature  or\t the statutory authority and read  into\t the\nconcerned  provision the principles of natural justice.\"  So\nalso  the right to be heard cannot be presumed when  in\t the\ncircumstances  of  the\tcase there  is\tparamount  need\t for\nsecrecy\t or  when  a  decision will  have  to  be  taken  in\nemergency  or when promptness of action is called for  where\ndelay would defeat the very purpose or where it is expected\n(1) [1971] 1 S.C.R. 791.\n769\nthat the person affected would take an obstructive attitude.\nTo  a  limited extent it may be necessary te  rovoke  or  to\nimpound\t  a  passport  without\tnotice\tif  there  is\treal\napprehension  that the holder of the passport may leave\t the\ncountry if he becomes aware of any intention on the part  of\nthe  passport  authority  or the  Government  to  revoke  or\nimpound the passport.  But that by itself would not  justify\ndenial\tof an opportunity to the holder of the\tpassport  to\nstate his case before a final order is passed.\tIt cannot be\ndisputed that the legislature has   not by express provision\nexcluded the right to be heard.\t When the passport authority\ntakes action under\nsection 10(5)\nhe is required to record in\nwriting\t a brief statement of reasons and furnish a copy  to\nthe  holder  of\t the  passport\ton  demand  unless  he\t for\nsufficient  reasons considers it not desirable to furnish  a\ncopy.  An order thus passed is subject to an appeal where an\nappellate  authority  is  required  to\tgive  a\t  reasonable\nopportunity to the holder of the passport to put forward his\ncase.  When an appeal has to be disposed of after given\t for\na  specified period the revocation or impounding during\t the\nwithout\t hearing  the  aggrieved  person.   Further  when  a\npassport  is given for a specified period the revocation  or\nimpounding during the period when the passport is valid\t can\nonly  be done for some valid reason.  There is a  difference\nbetween an authority revoking or modifying an order  already\npassed in favour of a person and initially refusing to grant\na licence.  In Purtabpur Co. v. Cane Commissioner, Bihar,(1)\nthe  Supreme  Court  held that \"it would not  be  proper  to\nequate\tan  order revoking or modifying a  licence  with,  a\ndecision not to grant a licence.\" In Schmidt v. Secretary of\nState,\tHome Affairs,(2) Lord Denning observed that \"If\t his\npermit\t(alien) is revoked before the time limit expires  he\nought,\tI  think,  to  be given\t an  opportunity  of  making\nrepresentation;\t for he would have a legitimate\t expectation\nof  'being  allowed to stay for the  permitted\ttime.\"\tLord\nDenning extended the application of the rule of audi alteram\npartem even in the case of a foreign alien who had no  right\nto  enter  the country.\t When a permit was granted  and\t was\nsubsequently  sought  to  be revoked it has  to\t be  treated\ndifferently  from that of refusing permission at  the  first\ninstance.   As\tin the present case the passport  which\t has\nbeen   granted\tis  sought  to\tbe  impounded\tthe   normal\npresumption  is\t that the action will not be  taken  without\ngiving a opportunity to the holder of the passport.\nSection\n10(3)\nin  enumerating\tthe several  grounds  on  which\t the\npassport authority may impound a passport has used the words\nlike  'if the authority is satisfied', \"the authority  deems\nit necessary to do so.\" The Privy Council in Durav- appah V.\nFernando(3)  after  referring  to  an  earlier\tdecision  in\nSugathadasa  v.\t Jayasinghe(4) disagreed with  the  decision\nholding\t \"As  a general rule that words such  as  'where  it\nappears\t to . . . .' or 'if it appears to  the\tsatisfaction\nof.....\t or 'if the considers it expedient that. . .  .'  or\n'if  the .... is satisfied that. . . standing by  themselves\nwithout\t other\twords  or  circumstances  of  qualification,\nexclude\t a  duty to act judicially.\" The  Privy\t Council  in\ndisagreeing with this approach observed\n(1) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 807.\n(2) [1969] 2 Ch. 149.\n(3) [1967] 2 A. C. 337,\n(4)  [1958] 59 N.L.R. 457.\n770\nthat  these various formulae are introductory of the  matter\nto  be\tconsidered and are given little\t guidance  upon\t the\nquestion of audi alteram partem. The   statute\tcan   make\nitself clear on this point and if it does cadit quaestio. If\nit  does  not  then the principle laid\tdown  in  Cooper  v.\nWardsworth Board of Works(1) where Byles, J. stated  \"A long\ncourse\tof decision, beginning with Dr. Bentley's case,\t and\nending with some very recent cases, establish, that although\nthere  are no positive words in the statute  requiring\tthat\nthe party shall be heard, yet the justice of the common\t law\nwill  supply  the  omission  of\t the  legislature.\"  In\t the\ncircumstances,\tthere  is  no material\tfor  coming  to\t the\nconclusion  that the right to be heard has been\t taken\taway\nexpressly or by necessary implication by the statute.\nI may at this stage refer to the stand taken by the  learned\nAttorney-General  on this question.\nAccording to him \"on  a\ntrue  construction,  the rule audi alteram  partenm  is\t not\nexcluded in ordinary cases and that the correct position  is\nlaid  down  by the Bombay High Court in the  case  of\nMinoo\nManeckshaw  v.\tUnion  of  India\n.( 2 )\tThe  view  taken  by\nTulzapurkar,  J. is that the rule of audi alteram partem  is\nnot excluded in making an order under\nsec. 10(3) (c)\nof\t the\nAct.   But  the Attorney General in  making  the  concession\nsubmitted  that\t the  rule  will  not  apply  when   special\ncircumstances  exist such as need for taking  prompt  action\ndue  to the urgency of the situation or where the  grant  of\nopportunity  would  defeat  the very object  for  which\t the\naction\tof  impounding\tis to be taken.\nThis\tposition  is\nsupported by the decision of Privy Council in De Verteuil v.\nKnaggs,(3) wherein it was stated 'it must, however, be borne\nin mind that there may be special circumstances which  would\nsatisfy\t a Governor, acting in good faith,   to take  action\neven  if  be  did  not give an\topportunity  to\t the  person\naffected  to make any relevant statement, or to\t correct  or\ncontrovert  any\t relevant statement brought forward  to\t his\nprejudice.\"  This  extraordinary step can be  taken  by\t the\npassport  authority  for impounding or revoking\t a  passport\nwhen  he apprehends that the passport holder may  leave\t the\ncountry\t and  as  such prompt action  is  essential.   These\nobservations  would  justify the authority  to\timpound\t the\npassport without notice but before any final order is passed\nthe  rule of audi alteram partem would apply and the  holder\nof the passport will have to be beard.\tI am satisfied\tthat\nthe  petitioner's  claim that she has a right  to  be  heard\nbefore\ta final order under\ns. 10(3) (c)\nis passed  is\tmade\nout.  In this view the question as to whether\nsec. 10(3) (c)\nis ultra vires or not does not arise.\nit was submitted on behalf of the state that an order  under\nsubclause 10(3) (c) is on the subjective satisfaction of the\npassport  authority  and  that as  the\tdecision  is  purely\n'administrative\t in character it cannot be questioned  in  a\ncourt  of  law except on very limited grounds.\t Though\t the\ncourts\thad  taken the view that the  principle\t of  natural\njustice is inapplicable to administrative orders, there\t 'is\na change in the judicial opinion subsequently.\tThe frontier\nbetween judicial or\n(1)  1723 1 Str. 557 ; Mod.  Rep. 148.\n(2)  76 B.L.R.(1974) 788.\n(3)  [1918] A. C 557\n771\nquasi  judicial\t determination\ton  the\t one  hand  and\t  an\nexecutive  or administrative determination on the other\t has\nbecome\tblurred.  The rigid view that principles of  natural\njustice applied only to judicial and quasi judicial acts and\nnot  to administrative acts no longer holds the field.\t The\nviews  taken  by  the courts on this subject  are  not\tcon-\nsistent.    While  earlier  decisions  were  in\t favour\t  of\nadministrative convenience and efficiency at the expense  of\nnatural\t justice, the recent view is in favour of  extending\nthe  application  of  natural justice and the  duty  to\t act\nfairly\twith  a caution that the principle  'should  not  be\nextended  to  the  extreme so as  to  affect  adversely\t the\nadministrative efficiency.  In this connection it is  useful\nto  quote  the oft-repeated ,observations  of  Lord  Justice\nTucker in Russell v. Duke of Norfolk(1) \"The requirements of\nnatural\t justice  must depend on the  circumstances  of\t the\ncase,  the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which\t the\ntribunal is acting , the subject matter that is being  dealt\nwith,  and so forth .... but, whatever standard is  adopted,\none  essential\tis that the person concerned should  have  a\nreasonable  opportunity\t of presenting his case.\" In  R.  v.\nGaming\tBoard Ex. p. Benaim,(2) Lord Denning held  that\t the\nview  that the principle of natural justice applied only  to\njudicial  proceedings and not to administrative\t proceedings\nhas  been  over-ruled in Ridge v. Baldwin.(3)  The  guidance\nthat  was  given to the Gaming Board was  that\tthey  should\nfollow\tthe principles laid down in the case  of  immigrants\nnamely\tthat they have no tight to come in, but they have  a\nright  to be heard.  The Court held in construing the  words\nthe Board \"Shall have regard only\" to the matter  specified,\nthe  Board  has a duty to act fairly and it  must  give\t the\napplicant  an opportunity of satisfying them of\t the  matter\nspecified in the section.  They must let him know what their\nimpressions are so that he can disabuse them.  The reference\nto  the\t cases of immigrants is to the\tdecisions  of  Chief\nJustice\t Parker\t in Re H. K. (An infant)(1).   In  cases  of\nimmigrants though they had no right to come into the country\nit  was\t held  that they have a right to  be  heard.   These\nobservations  apply to the present case and the plea of\t the\npetitioner  that  the authority should act fairly  and\tthat\nthey  must let her know what their impressions are so  that,\nif possible, she can disabuse them, is sound.\nIn  American law also the decisions regarding the  scope  of\njudicial  review is not uniform.  So far  as  constitutional\nrights\tare involved due process of law imports\t a  judicial\nreview\t of  the  action  of  administrative  or   executive\nofficers.   This  proposition is undisputed so\tfar  as\t the\nquestions  of law are concerned but the extent to which\t the\nCourt  should go and will go in reviewing determinations  of\nfact has been a highly controversial issue.\n(Constitution of the United States of America, P. 1152, 1973\nEd.)\nOn  a consideration of various authorities it is clear\tthat\nwhere\tthe   decision\tof  the\t authority   entails   civil\nconsequences and the petition is\n(1)   [1949] 1 All E.R.109,118.\n(2)  [1970] 2 Q.B. 417.\n(3)  [1964] A.C. 40\n(4)  [1967] 2 Q.B.617, at 630.\n772\nprejudicially  affected he must be given an opportunity\t to,\nbe  heard  and\tpresent\t his case.   This  Court  in\nBarium\nChemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board\n(\n1) and Rohtas Industries\nLtd.  v. S. D. Agrawal\n,(2) has held that a limited  judicial\nscrutiny  of the impugned decision on the point of  rational\nand  reasonable nexus was open to a court of law.\nAn  order\npassed\tby an authority based on subjective satisfaction  is\nliable\tto  judicial scrutiny to a limited extent  has\tbeen\nlaid  down in\nU.P. Electric Co. v. State of U.P.\n(3)  wherein\nconstruing  the\t provisions  of\ns.  3(2)(e)\nof\t the  Indian\nElectricity  Act 9 of 1910 as amended by the U.P. Act 30  of\n1961, where the language used is similar to\ns. 10(3) (c)\nof\nthe  Passport Act, this Court held that when the  Government\nexercises its power on the ground that it \"deems such supply\nnecessary in public interest\" if challenged, the  Government\nmust  make out that exercise of the power was  necessary  in\nthe  public interest.  The Court is not intended to  sit  in\nappeal over the satisfaction of the Government.\t If there is\nprima  facie evidence on which a reasonable body of  persons\nmay hold that it is in the public interest to supply  energy\nto consumers the, requirements of the statute are fulfilled.\n\"In  our judgment, the satisfaction of the  Government\tthat\nthe  supply  is\t necessary  in the  public  interest  is  in\nappropriate  cases not excluded from judicial  review.\"\t The\ndecisions cited are clear authority for the proposition that\nthe order passed under\ns. 10(3) (c)\nis subject to a  limited\njudicial scrutiny.  An order under\ns. 10(3) (c)\nthough it is\nheld to be an administrative order passed on the  subjective\nsatisfaction   of  the\tauthority  cannot  escape   judicial\nscrutiny.   The\t Attorney General fairly  conceded  that  an\norder under\nS. 10 (3) (c)\nis subject to a judicial  scrutiny\nand  that it can be looked into by the court to the  limited\nextent\tof satisfying itself whether the order passed has  a\nrational  and  reasonable  nexus to  the  interests  of\t the\ngeneral public.\nIt  was next contended on behalf of the petitioner that\t the\nprovisions  of\ns.  10(5)\nof the  Act\twhich  empowers\t the\nPassport  authority or the Government to decline  furnishing\nthe holder of the passport a brief statement of the  reasons\nfor making an order if the authority is of the opinion\tthat\nit will not be in the interest of sovereignty and  integrity\nof  India,  security of India, friendly relations  of  India\nwith any foreign country, or in the interests of the general\npublic is unsustainable in law.\t It was submitted that along\nwith the right to refuse to furnish a copy of the order made\nby the Government, as a right of appeal is denied against an\norder  made  by the Central Govt. the provisions  should  be\nregarded  as. total denial or procedure and  arbitrary.\t  In\nview  of  the construction which is placed on\nS.  10(3)\t (c)\nthat  the  holder of the passport is entitled  to  be  heard\nbefore the passport authority deems it necessary to  impound\na passport, it cannot be said that there is total denial  of\nprocedure.  The authority under\ns. 10(5)\nis bound to  record\nin  writing a brief statement of the reasons for  making  an\norder  and furnish to the holder of the passport  or  travel\ndocu-\n(1)  [1966] Sup. S.C.R. 31 1.\n(2)  [1969] 3 S.C.R. 108\n(3)  [1969]  3 S.C.R. 865.\n773\nment  on demand a copy of the same, unless in any case,\t the\npassport authority is of the opinion that it will not be  in\nthe interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the\nsecurity  of  India,  friendly relation of  India  with\t any\nforeign\t country  or in the interests of general  public  to\nfurnish such a copy.  The grounds on which the authority may\nrefuse to furnish the reasons are the same as provided in\ns.\n10  (3)(c)\nfor impounding a passport but the two powers\t are\nexercisable  in\t totally  different  contexts.\t Under\nsec.\n10(3)\n, the question that has to be considered is whether the\npassport has to be impounded in the interests of sovereignty\nand  integrity of India etc. or in the interests of  general\npublic.\t  In passing an order under\nsec. 10(5)\nit has to  be\nconsidered  whether in the interests of the sovereignty\t and\nintegrity  of  India  etc. or in the  interests\t of  general\npublic,\t furnishing of a copy of the reasons for the  order,\nshould\tbe declined.  Though the same grounds are  mentioned\nfor impounding a passport as well as for refusing to furnish\nthe reasons for making an order, it would not mean that when\nan order under\ns. 10(3) (c)\nis passed it would automatically\napply to\ns. 10(5)\nand for the same reason the authority\t can\ndecline to furnish the reasons for the order.\nS. 10(5)\nsays\nthat  the  authority  shall furnish to\tthe  holder  of\t the\npassport  on demand a copy unless in any case the  authority\nit  of\topinion\t that it will not be  in  the  interests  of\nsovereignty  and  integrity of India  etc.   The  expression\n\"unless in any case\" would indicate that it is not in  every\ncase  that the authority can decline to furnish reasons\t for\nthe order.  There may be some, cases, and I feel that it can\nbe  only  in  very rare cases, that a  copy  containing\t the\nreasons\t for making such order can be refused.\tThough\trare\nthere may be some cases in which: it would be, expedient for\nthe  authority to decline to furnish a copy of\tthe  reasons\nfor making such order.\tBut that could only be an  exception\nis  indicated from the fact that the aggrieved person has  a\nright  of appeal under\ns. 1\n1\nwhich has to be decided  after\ngiving a reasonable opportunity of representing his case.  A\nreasonable  opportunity cannot Ordinarily be  given  without\ndisclosing  to\tthat person the reasons for the\t order.\t  In\nthose  rare  ,cases in which a copy for the reasons  of\t the\norder  is  declined  by the passport authority\tand  is\t not\nfurnished during the hearing of the appeal, it would furnish\nsufficient justification for the courts to have a close look\ninto the reasons for the order and satisfy itself whether it\nhas  been  properly made.  But I am unable to,\tsay  that  a\nprovision which empowers the authority to decline to furnish\nreasons for making the order is not within the competence of\nthe  legislature.  The learned counsel for  the\t petitioner,\nwith  some  justification, submitted that if no\t reasons  we\nfurnished by the Govt. and no appeal is provided against the\norder  of the Govt. it would virtually amount to  denial  of\nprocedure  established by law as contemplated under\nArt.  21\nof the ,Constitution of India.\tThough there is considerable\nforce  in this submission.  I am unable to accept this\tplea\nfor  two  reasons.\nFirstly, the Govt. is bound to  give  an\nopportunity  to\t the holder of the passport  before  finally\nrevoking  or impounding it.  I expect the case in which\t the\nauthority  declines  to furnish reasons for making  such  an\norder  would be extremely rare.\t In such cases it should  be\nborn  in mind that when the Govt. itself passes an order  it\nshould\tbe presumed that it would have made the order  after\ncareful scrutiny.  If an order is passed\n11-119 SCI/79\n774\nby  the passport authority, an appeal is provided.   If\t the\nGovt. passes an order, though no appeal is provided for, but\nas the power is vested in the highest authority the  section\nis   not  unconstitutional--(\nChinta  Lingam  and   Ors.\t  v.\nGovernment of India\n& ors.(1) for the order would be subject\nto  judicial  scrutiny\tby the High Court  and\tthe  Supreme\nCourt.\t I  feel  that\tin the\tcircumstances  there  is  no\njustification for holding that\nS. 10(5)\nof the Act is  ultra\nvires of the powers of the legislature.\t We have taken\tnote\nof  the fact that in the present case there is no reason  in\ndeclining  to  furnish to the petitioner  the  statement  of\nreasons for impounding the passport but such a lapse by\t the\nauthority  would  not  make\nsec. 10(5)\nultra  vires  of\t the\npowers of the legislature.\nIt was next contended that in the present case the  passport\nwas  impounded under\nS. 10(3) (c)\nof the Act on\t the  ground\nthat  (a)  it is in the public interest\t that  Smt.   Maneka\nGandhi should be able to give evidence before the Commission\nof 'Inquiry and, (b) that Smt.\tManeka Gandhi should have an\nopportunity  to present her views before the  Commission  of\nInquiry\t and  according\t to  a\treport\treceived  there\t  is\nlikelihood  of\tSmt.  Maneka Gandhi leaving India.   It\t was\nsubmitted  that\t impounding of the passport  on\t the  ground\nstated\tabove  is unjustified.\tReferring to\nS.  10(3)\t (h)\nwhere  it is provided that when it is brought to the  notice\nof  the\t passport authority that a warrant  or\tsummons\t for\nappearance or a warrant for the arrest of the holder of\t the\npassport  has been issued by a court under any law  for\t the\ntime being in force or if an order prohibiting the departure\nfrom  India  of the holder of the passport or  other  travel\ndocument  has been made by any such court and  the  passport\nauthority is satisfied that a warrant or summons has been so\nissued\tor an order has been so made, impound the  passport.\nFor  application of this clause there must be a\t warrant  or\nsummons from the court or an order by the Court\t prohibiting\nthe  departure from India.  It was submitted that it is\t not\ncertain whether the Commission would require the presence of\nthe  petitioner at all and if required. when  her.  presence\nwill  be  necessary.   There  had been\tno  summons  or\t any\nrequisition  from the Commission of Inquiry  requiring\t'the\npetitioner's  presence\tand  in such  circumstances  it\t was\nsubmitted  that the order is without any  justification.   A\nnotification  issued  by the Ministry  of  External  Affairs\nunder  s. 22(a) of the\nPassports Act\non 14-4-76 was  brought\nto  our\t notice.   By that notification\t the  Central  Govt.\nconsidered  that it is necessary in the public\tinterest  to\nexempt citizens of India against whom proceedings in respect\nof  an\toffence alleged to have been committed by  them\t are\npending before a criminal court in India and if they produce\norders\tfrom the Court concerned permitting them  to  depart\nfrom  India from the operations of the provisions of  clause\n(f)  of\t sub-section (2) of\ns. 6\nof the Act subject  to\t the\ncondition  that the passport will be issued to such  citizen\nonly for, a period specified in such order of the Court\t and\nif no period is.specified the passport shall be issued for a\nperiod of six months and may be renewed for a further period\nof six months if the order of the\n(1) [1971] 2 S.C.R. 871 at p. 876.\n775\ncourt  is  not cancelled or modified.  The citizen  is\talso\nrequired  to give an undertaking to the\t passport  authority\nthat  he shall, if required by the court  concerned,  appear\nbefore if at any time during the continuance in force of the\npassport  so  issued.\tIt  was\t submitted  that  when\tsuch\nfacility is provided for a person who is being tried for  an\noffence\t in  a\tcriminal court the same\t facility  at  least\nshould\tbe  given to a person who may be  required  to\tgive\nevidence before a Commission of Inquiry.  It is\t unnecessary\nfor  me\t to  go\t into the question  as\tto  whether  in\t the\ncircumstances the impounding of the passport is justified or\nnot for the' learned Attorney General submitted that the im-\npounding  was for the purpose of preventing  the  petitioner\nfrom  leaving  the country and that a final  decision-as  to\nwhether the passport will have to be impounded and if so for\nwhat  period  will  be\tdecided later.\t On  behalf  of\t the\nGovernment a statement was filed which is as follows\n\"1. The Government is agreeable to considering\nany  representation  that may be made  by\t the\npetitioner in respect of the impounding of her\npassport and giving her an opportunity in\t the\nmatter.  The opportunity will be given  within\ntwo    weeks   of\t  the\treceipt\t   of\t the\nrepresentation.   It is clarified that  in\tth\ne\npresent case, the grounds for impounding\t'the\npassport are those mentioned in the  affidavit\nin reply dated 18th August, 1977 of Shri Ghosh\nexcept those mentioned in para 2(xi).\n2.  The representation of the petitioner\twill\nbe dealt with expeditiously in accordance with\nlaw.\n3. In the event of the decision of  impounding\nthe passing having confirmed, it is  clarified\nthat  the duration of the impounding will\t not\nexceed a period of six months from the date of\nthe   decision  that  may\t be  taken  on\t the\npetitioner's representation.\n4.   Pending   the   consideration   of\t the\npetitioner's  represen- tation and  until\t the\ndecision\tof the Government of India  thereon,\nthe  petitioner's\t passport  shall  remain  in\ncustody of this Honourable Court.\n5. This will be without prejudice to the power\nof the Government of India to take such action\nas  it may be advised in accordance  with\t the\nprovisions  of the\nPassport Act\nin respect  of\nthe petitioner's passport.\"\nIn  view  of the statement that the petitioner\tmay  make  a\nrepresentation in respect of impounding of passport and that\nthe  representations  will be dealt with  expeditiously\t and\nthat even if the impounding of the passport is confirmed  it\nwill not exceed a period of six months from the date, of the\ndecision  that\tmay  be taken  on  the\tpetitioner's  repre-\nsentation, it is not necessary for me to go into the  merits\nof  the case any further.  The Attorney General\t assured  us\nthat all the grounds\n776\nurged  before us by the petitioner and the grounds that\t may\nbe urged before the authority will be properly considered by\nthe authority and appropriate orders passed.\nIn the result, I hold that the petitioner is not entitled to\nany  of the fundamental rights enumerated-in\nArticle  19\nof\nthe Constitution and that the\nPassport Act\ncomplies with the\nrequirements  of\nArt.\t21\nof the  Constitution\t and  is  in\naccordance  with  the  procedure  established  by  law.\t   I\nconstrue\nsection 10(3)(c)\nas providing a right to the holder\nof  the passport to be heard before the\t passport  authority\nand that any order passed under\nsection 10(3)\nis subject  to\na  limited  judicial  scrutiny by the, High  Court  and\t the\nSupreme Court.\nIn  view  of  the statement made  by  the  learned  Attorney\nGeneral\t to  which  reference  has  already  been  made\t  in\njudgment, I do not think it necessary to formally  interfere\nwith the impugned order.
