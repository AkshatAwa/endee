The IOA outlined the conditions under which J&K became a part of the Indian Union. As a result, J&K was granted a higher level of autonomy within India’s federal system. Additionally, the Draft Article provided for the establishment of the J&K Constituent Assembly with the purpose of drafting a unique J&K Constitution. This Assembly had the authority to determine which provisions of the Indian Constitution would apply to the State in the future.\nA member\nasked\nwhy the Draft Article gave J&K a special constitutional status. A Drafting Committee member\nresponded\narguing that the unique political circumstances around J&K required such a special provision. These circumstances included the on-going war in the State, the involvement of the United Nations, and the promises made by the Indian Government to State which included the State’s right to decide its political future. Despite this clarification, the Member\nappeared\nunconvinced and suggested that the Draft Article was discriminatory as the other Princely States like the State of Baroda received no such political concessions.\nAt the end of the debate, the Constituent Assembly\nadopted\nthe Draft Article without amendments on 17 October 1949.\nOn 6 August 2019, Article 370 of the Constitution was effectively repealed through a\nPresidential order\non the recommendation of both Houses of Parliament.\nWe are a not-for-profit initiative.
